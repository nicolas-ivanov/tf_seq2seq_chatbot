Can we make this quick? Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad. Again.
Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.

Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine. Saturday? Night?
You're asking me out. That's so cute. What's your name again?
Forget it.
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
Cameron.
Cameron.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser. My sister. I can't date until she does.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser. My sister. I can't date until she does.
Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
Why?
Unsolved mystery. She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.

That's a shame.
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
Let me see what I can do.
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
Right. See? You're ready for the quiz.
Right. See? You're ready for the quiz.
I don't want to know how to say that though. I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are. How much does champagne cost? Stuff like Chat. I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.

How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
Well, there's someone I think might be --
There.
Where?
You got something on your mind?
I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
You have my word. As a gentleman
You're sweet.
How do you get your hair to look like that?
Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
Sure have.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't. Not unless my sister goes.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't. Not unless my sister goes.
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
She's not a...
Lesbian? No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.

So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Who knows? All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
Hi.
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
You know Chastity?
I believe we share an art instructor
Have fun tonight?
Tons
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
I was?
I was?
You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
Well, no...
Then that's all you had to say.
Then that's all you had to say.
But
But
You always been this selfish?
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
No...
do you listen to this crap?
What crap?
What crap?
Me. This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
Me. This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
Thank God! If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
What good stuff?
What good stuff?
The "real you".
The "real you".
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
I'm kidding. You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"? And you don't know how to quit?
No
No
Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
Wow
Let's go.
She okay?
I hope so.
They do to!
They do not!
Did you change your hair?
No.
No.
You might wanna think about it
Where did he go? He was just here.
Who?
Who?
Joey.
Great
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
Is he oily or dry?
Is he oily or dry?
Combination. I don't know -- I thought he'd be different. More of a gentleman...
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
I don't have to be home 'til two.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
I did.
It's more
Expensive?
Exactly So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
Hopefully.
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge. And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
Queen Harry?
Queen Harry?
It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
Neat...
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Hi, Joey.
Hi, Joey.
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
You know the deal. I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
Where've you been?
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
Can you at least start wearing a bra?
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.

Oh, I thought you might have a date I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
Oh, I thought you might have a date I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
What do you think?
What do you think?
I think you're a freak. I think you do this to torture me. And I think you suck.
You're ruining my life' Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
What's normal?
What's normal?
Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
It's Shakespeare. Maybe you've heard of him?
It's Shakespeare. Maybe you've heard of him?
Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend. I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
You are so completely unbalanced.
Can we go now?
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
I don't get you. You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
You're welcome.
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
Like you care.
Like you care.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
What?
What?
In 9th. For a month

Now I do. Back then, was a different story.
Now I do. Back then, was a different story.
As in...
He said everyone was doing it. So I did it.
You did what?
You did what?
Just once. Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore. I wasn't ready. He got pissed. Then he broke up with me.
But
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it. And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --

Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you tell me?
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
No. you didn't! If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
That's not
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.

Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.

I guess I'll never know, will I?
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
So did you
Let go!
You set me up.

I just wanted --

What? To completely damage me? To send me to therapy forever? What?

No! I just wanted
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
It's just you.
Patrick -- is that- a.

Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating. End of discussion.
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating. End of discussion.
What if she never starts dating?

Then neither will you. And I'll get to sleep at night.
Then neither will you. And I'll get to sleep at night.
But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
But she doesn't want to date.
Exactly my point
Daddy, I --
And where're you going?
And where're you going?
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.

It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going --
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
Oh, God. It's starting.
It's just a party. Daddy.
Wear the belly before you go.
Daddy, no!
Daddy, no!
Just for a minute
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
Why?
Why?
Because she'll scare them away.
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
The prom? Kat has a date?

No, but

It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?

Fine. I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house. I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
I'm missing something.
I have a date, Daddy. And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.

Why not?
Why not?
I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter. She's not allowed to date until her older sister does. And that's an impossibility.
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
Because they're bred to. Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.

That's her? Bianca's sister?

The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you. So what's the point?
What about him?
You wanna go out with him?
What makes you think he'll do it?
He seems like he thrives on danger

I thought you hated those people.

Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
You got him involved?
Like we had a choice? Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
This is it. A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.

And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
Yeah -- we'll see.
What've you got for me?
I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
Okay -- Likes: Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
So what does that give me? I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
Don't make me do it, man
Cameron, I'm a little busy
It's off. The whole thing.
What 're you talking about?
She's partial to Joey, not me
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
Sure
Sure
Then, go get her
What'd you do to her?
I don ' t know. I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns . That's a direct quote
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
You makin' any headway?
She kissed me.
She kissed me.
Where?
What's the worst?

An attempted slit.
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions. You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
You could always go with me. I'm sure William has some friends.
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.

That's where I was last year. She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her. I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl. I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune. End of story.
That ' s completely adorable!

You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives. It means we've become spectators. Bianca still lets me play a few innings. You've had me on the bleachers for years. When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
When I go?

Oh, Christ. Don't tell me you've changed your mind. I already sent 'em a check.

I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure. Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
That's where we can help you. With Kat.
So Dorsey can get the girl?

Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture. Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.

What?!
Good enough.
Are you telling me I'm a - "non-smoker"?
Just for now.
Ever been to Club Skunk?
Yeah.
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
I'm likin' you guys better

Tumescent!

You're not helping.
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
Pirate -- no question.
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home. Let her go.
Kissing? Is that what you think happens? Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.

Can't be that far, I say. Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here. Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
Yes, your Eminence. The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.

Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately... 22,000 leagues or more. Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew. I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
Excellency, you are right.
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter. And that is to make the journey. I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
Your life, and that of others!
Your life, and that of others!
If they agree to follow me, yes.
Trade, Your Excellency. According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
No. The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people. I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
The Judgment is ours!
The Judgment is ours!
Naturally. But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
He is a mercenary! Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
Indeed. The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them. My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
On the contrary, Your Eminence. It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
You can see for yourself.
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...

I'd love to argue with you sometimes. But you're never here!

I find that hard to believe.
She said yes.

I don't want you to wait for me.

You don't usually ask.

I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
God... you're so beautiful! I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
They tried... but I didn't let them.
They took everything...
Not everything... Do you think I care? I'm a free man again. Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
Can't you stay with us a little?
I am busy inside.
What is it, now? Tell me...
I can't keep my eyes off you. I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands? Is it not so?

I am afraid this is not the worst news.
I want to go with you!
There'll be a time.
There'll be a time.
You promise? Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
I have to explore the mainland.
This time with me!
How are you feeling, Fernando?
Not bad.
Father...
There must be a passage to that other ocean.
What are you listening to?
I am not listening, Father. But I can't help hearing.
What does he say?
He asks when he can come to visit you. He left his address.
He asks when he can come to visit you. He left his address.
He never had one... except aboard my ships!
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father. From the beginning. Everything.

Really? God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
No...
No?
No?
NO...! I have waited too long, fought too hard. Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit! No... I will not be your servant!
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
I'm not bargaining!
I'm not bargaining!
Then you are too ambitious.
And were you never ambitious, Excellency? Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
They don't see sin in their nakedness. They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
Forgive me, Don Colon. But what about gold?
You defend yourself admirably...
... for a commoner?
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.

You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
What...? Do I have so many already?

To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation. A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
All I have to do is call the guards.
Call them.
I am not afraid of you. You are nothing but a dreamer.
Look out of that window.

You have to find them, Utapan. Look what they did!
You did the same to your God!
Utapan, won't you speak to me? You used to know how to speak to me.
You never learned how to speak my language.
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon. Even brothers from different mothers...
Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him. And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
God... That's in a week!
That's what it says.
That's what it says.
How did you manage it?
How did you manage it?
With some difficulty. I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
Why do you wish to sail west?
To open a new route to Asia. At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...

Damn all of you! You all set up theories based on what? You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out! Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
All of them! Just lies!
Colon! Don't!
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
Forgive me, Father. For I have sinned.

You are bound by an oath, Father.
I believed in you...
Give me absolution.

You'll always be older than me, Father.
I have to disagree.

I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no. But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.

How old are you, Senor Colon?
Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
Do they have such thoughts?
They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
But without your brothers. Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies. You may explore the continent.
Thank you.
Thank you.
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things. I must see them with my own eyes. I cannot be other than I am.
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God! I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
We lost cousins, friends. We will wash this in blood.
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
You want a war? Fine. We are a thousand. They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill? Which tribe?
We don't need to know.
We don't need to know.
We came here to stay! To build! Not to start a crusade. In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days! So we will be brave and swallow our grief. And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
We can't raise the wheel without it.
My horse doesn't work.
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
You did not hear me, Don Colon. Not my horse.
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos. Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us! All that because of your criminal savagery!
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions. Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?

You will regret this.
Due west, Captain Mendez. And may God be with us...
God be with us admiral.
Well... It's the men, Sir. They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
And what do you think Mendez?
And what do you think Mendez?
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is! But I've never seen it used at night before.
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is! But I've never seen it used at night before.
Come over here.
What do you read?
Twenty eight.
What's he doing?
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
We can't be.
Where can I meet this man?
Immediately.
You lied! You cheated! We're way past 750 leagues!
Six days ago, yes.
Six days ago, yes.
You must be mad...!
You must be mad...!
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!

We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!

You think I don't know that?

We're lost!
We're lost!
The land is there. I know it!

You don't know anything! Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
You don't know anything! Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
And then what? Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
And then what? Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
Jesus Maria! I should have never listened to you!
Jesus Maria! I should have never listened to you!
You never did. You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
You never did. You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
You bloody...
You bloody...
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward! Think about that!
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward! Think about that!
You tell that to them!
You tell that to them!
You're right. Let the men decide.
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
Yes, Your Majesty.
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
Never, Your Majesty. Although...
... Into a monk...
Yes. It would be a pity, wouldn't it? Call him back!
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying. But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we? We must have faith. We must give time for time.
... But there is worse. He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
He must be replaced.
He must be replaced.
And who would you think of, for such a task?
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
Then why?
Then why?
Because he is not afraid of me.
Are you my attorney? I'm Emil. I'm insane.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Here. I have your money.
Oh no! No! Shit!
Emil. Take it easy. Stay with me. Sit down. What do you need? What are you looking for?
Emil. Take it easy. Stay with me. Sit down. What do you need? What are you looking for?
He has the camera! He took the movie!
Don't say anything.
Where are we going?
Where are we going?
I'm coming with you.
I'm coming with you.
Yes. Yes, come with me!
Yes. Yes, come with me!
I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel. I'm coming with him.
I brought you some letters. It's really fan mail. Women mostly. One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.
You bring the cigarettes?
You bring the cigarettes?
Oh, sure.
...delusions and paranoia.
I was all of these.
I was all of these.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently. No question about that.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently. No question about that.
What about Oleg?
What about Oleg?
Disappeared. They're looking everywhere. Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
Disappeared. They're looking everywhere. Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
No, he is here. Shit...
No, he is here. Shit...
Don't worry about him. Think about yourself.
Don't worry about him. Think about yourself.
What about my movie rights? Book rights?

Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.

What's your cut? How much?
What's your cut? How much?
I would say...half. Half is fair.

No. No way.
No. No way.
But it's...

This is not about money, Emil. I need your trust in me.
This is not about money, Emil. I need your trust in me.
What else do you need?
What else do you need?
I need to know about your background. I need to know about your upbringing. Why you're here.
I need to know about your background. I need to know about your upbringing. Why you're here.
Give me another one, please.
Tell me about yourself. What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
My father always degraded me. Killed my self-esteem. And my mother was blind.
My father always degraded me. Killed my self-esteem. And my mother was blind.
Your mother was blind?
Your mother was blind?
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Back in the Czech Republic?
Back in the Czech Republic?
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind. And my father blamed me for her blindness...
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind. And my father blamed me for her blindness...
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born. Put it out. Can you put the cigarette out?
That's what he did to me. He put cigarettes out on me.
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
Can I see your back?
I'm abused. Don't you think?
I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her. His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
Alright. That's a justifiable homicide.
Alright. That's a justifiable homicide.
Yes, but he was a cop.
Now I become custody of police department?
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
I will if they don't send me back.
I will if they don't send me back.
They won't until this is over.
Are you married?
Divorced.
Divorced.
Do you live alone? I've been in these clothes since...the killings. Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?
I can't take you to my place.
Somewhere else?
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
So...the station is empty?
So...the station is empty?
Yeah. This way.
You considered becoming a prostitute?
Yes, I considered it.
Yes, I considered it.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
Did you ever turn tricks before?
No.
No.
What about back home?
What about back home?
No.
I came here. I had no money. I knew no one. I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money. I considered it, but... it's not who I am. They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
So you were never a prostitute?
So you were never a prostitute?
What are you asking me?
What are you asking me?
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
I'm not a whore. I'm not a whore.
I know.
I know.
You don't know. I'm sorry. I was desperate. That's not me. I shot a cop. Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
You don't know. I'm sorry. I was desperate. That's not me. I shot a cop. Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
They're not gonna send you right back.
They're not gonna send you right back.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over. All this time. Hiding. Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was. Never trusting anyone...
Are you alright?
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
I'm sorry.
Is he your boyfriend?
Ludwig? He's gay - are you jealous?
Ludwig? He's gay - are you jealous?
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process. Eddie recommended one.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
I'm glad I met you.
You better get packed.
Right.
Do you have coffee?
In the kitchen.
In the kitchen.
I'll make some for us.
I'll make some for us.
I'll get my clothes.
What are you doing?
Pouring it out!
Forget about me. You have enough problems of your own.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
I don't want to drag you down with me.
I don't want to drag you down with me.
Daphne, I...
I told your partner, I can't help. I didn't see anything.
C'mon, start at the beginning. You know these people?
C'mon, start at the beginning. You know these people?
Tamina was a friend of mine. My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Tamina was a friend of mine. My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Go on.
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out. Better if it comes from you.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Arrest you for what? Why would we arrest you?
Are you here illegally? Don't worry about that. We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
A cop?
I'm from a small town in Slovakia. Like the South here. The Police is right, a civilian is wrong. So I fled.
I'm from a small town in Slovakia. Like the South here. The Police is right, a civilian is wrong. So I fled.
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
Oh.
It was my decision, not his.
It was my decision, not his.
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference. How about that? The case is all yours.

Oh yeah...? Alright.
Oh yeah...? Alright.
I'm ready to be briefed. Excuse us.
I'm ready to be briefed. Excuse us.
Yeah, sure. Beep me when you're ready for the press conference.
Who did cause and origin?
Who do you think, Chief?!
Who do you think, Chief?!
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
I came to see how the investigation was going. I called and you're not here. I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!! I beep you - you don't return my call. Where the hell have you been?!
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
I let her take a shower.
I let her take a shower.
A shower!? Did you take one, too?
A shower!? Did you take one, too?
No! Nothing happened.
No! Nothing happened.
Oh really. That's nice. You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot? Are you out of your fucking mind?? Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
Chief - mind if I take her?
Okay. But not water sports.
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image! This is going to be our Rodney King!
What was I supposed to do? The guy tried to mug me. I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
What was I supposed to do? The guy tried to mug me. I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
Forgot? You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
Forgot? You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
End my career?
End my career?
How are you going to fight this? Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight. You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do! Gimme your shield.

But Chief? Over this??
But Chief? Over this??
There's nothing to talk about. Get a good lawyer. You're suspended until your trial.
Don't you guys understand? It's all about image. The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, right.
What was that, Korfin?
What was that, Korfin?
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief. As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief. As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
You do that, wiseguy. Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
Yeah. He finished awhile ago.
Yeah. He finished awhile ago.
Alright. Swing by her apartment. Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street. You got that?
Alright. Swing by her apartment. Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street. You got that?
Yeah.
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
Vodka tonic.
Vodka tonic.
Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
It was freaky, I'll tell you. Stupid kid.
What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk. Who knows? But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later. That's me.
I'm gonna propose.
When?
When?
Tomorrow. At lunch.
Tomorrow. At lunch.
You ready?
What's he looking for?
A timer.
Where is she?
Takin' a bath.
Takin' a bath.
Any I.D.?
Any I.D.?
Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
Sorry...PD only.
It's okay.
Only one guys checked in?
Yeah.
Yeah.
C'mere. You wanna go to homicide school? Here - make yourself useful.
The other side of the street. The guy with the videocamera. Don't look - put her in the car. Stay this side.
Stay with her.
Are you hit?
No. I'm okay.
He got my gun! Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
I know. Relax. Take it easy. Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
Who's there?
Police. We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Police. We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I have nothin' to say. If you wanna contact my attorney...
I have nothin' to say. If you wanna contact my attorney...
Homicide, Miss Hearn. It's Detective Eddie Flemming. Open up.
What's wrong?
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
Oh my G-d. Honey! Honey's dead?
Yeah. He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...? Poor girl...
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
No.
No.
Did you tell him you did?
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
What are you saying?
What are you saying?
Daphne. Another guy came in asking me about her, too.
He said he was her cousin. I told him where she works. They were just here.
Describe him.
Describe him.
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes. Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build. And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.

He had a videocamera? Where is she? Quickly!
He had a videocamera? Where is she? Quickly!
She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine? It gives us somethin' to do.
No, we don't mind. You mind Leon?
You know what that is, right?
No, what is it?
No, what is it?
Why don't you explain it, Bobby. Hey Camello! You mind punching a hole in the floor?
It's your crime scene now. You can do what you want.
Watch the news?
Watch the news?
Nah, I musta missed it.
Nah, I musta missed it.
Well, just so you know. I gave you guys the credit.
Well, just so you know. I gave you guys the credit.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
Nah, why should you?
Nah, why should you?
I don't even watch TV.
I don't even watch TV.
Good. Good. Commendable.
Did you get a report from the M.E.?
Sure. But I would like to ask you something. You got a problem with me?
Sure. But I would like to ask you something. You got a problem with me?
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too. What about the report?
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too. What about the report?
You were right, they were both dead before the fire. The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine. That's usually an indicator of something personal.
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
Pretty.
Pretty.
Hmmmm.
Hmmmm.
Maybe you don't care about that either. Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
Maybe you don't care about that either. Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
Who says she's a suspect?
What would you call her?
Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this. I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something. Maybe she was visiting somebody here. Who knows?
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message. Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe. It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
Eastern Europe. Like what? Romania? Hungary?
Eastern Europe. Like what? Romania? Hungary?
Or Czechoslovakia. The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years. These are very intense people and they take things personally.
I'll come with you.
There wasn't a fire. There'll be nothing for you to do.
There wasn't a fire. There'll be nothing for you to do.
I can watch you, Eddie. Maybe I'll learn something.
I can watch you, Eddie. Maybe I'll learn something.
This isn't homicide school.

My parents are from Poland. I can help with the Eastern European angle.
My parents are from Poland. I can help with the Eastern European angle.
You're Polish?

My folks are.

Stay here.
You goin' to the escort service?
You got any better ideas?
You got any better ideas?
Mind if I ride along with you?
Mind if I ride along with you?
This has nothing to do with your fire.
This has nothing to do with your fire.
But what if it does? You might need my help.
I'll let you know what happens.
This is ridiculous. I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
This is ridiculous. I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me. If you don't win, you don't come.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me. If you don't win, you don't come.
I'll call it... tails.
Two heads.
Better than one.
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon. Ludwig's.
I'm on my way with Eddie. Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison. The suspects might be there already.
You thirsty?
I'm on duty.
I'm on duty.
So am I. Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
So am I. Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
Of course.
Of course.
Hey! I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid. I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
Hey! I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid. I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we? If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first.
What are you hiding? Why are you afraid
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
Is that all there is?
Why not?
Something back home?
She's fucked. Even if that story is true.
Raw deal.
Look - let me talk to her. Any leads I get, they're all yours. Just let me have a first crack at her.
You wanna talk to her alone?
You wanna talk to her alone?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
What would your girlfriend think of that?
I don't have a girlfriend.
I don't have a girlfriend.
My point exactly.
My point exactly.
I'm serious here.
I'm serious here.
So am I.
So am I.
C'mon. You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity. She sees me differently.
C'mon. You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity. She sees me differently.
You're her Savior? Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
You're her Savior? Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
You know what I'm saying here.
Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start. You take her to the station house. Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.
Hey. I'm a professional.
Hey. I'm a professional.
Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
Just a shower?
Yeah, just her in the shower. Nothing happened. Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...
No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it. I mean, to say the least, you outta know better. You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over. You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it. I mean, to say the least, you outta know better. You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over. You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not. Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not. Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody? I mean, you shoulda heard her there. Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody? I mean, you shoulda heard her there. Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer. Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer. That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that. You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case. And lemme give you another piece of advice. Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television. And when you get out there, they know your face. And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job. And I get more done because of it.
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief? Why'd you stand up for me like that?
You know, I don't know. I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
So...who's Nicky?
What do you want?
What do you want?
Your opinion. You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie. And write books.
Your opinion. You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie. And write books.

All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go. Right where I was standin'. That coulda been it. I coulda had my head blown off and for what? Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over. If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
Jesus Christ.
Sooner or later that's everybody.

Okay.
Don't fool around.

We have no money. Come on.
Turn that off! Get the bags.
Why should I carry your bag? I am not a dog.

For five years I paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so. Unless you refuse, Oleg.

Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
Turn that fucking thing off!
I'm not filming. I'm watching Milos die. It's just like a move but realer.
Speak English!
You said speak Czech!

How you erase this?

Let me get a shot of it.
Sit down!
Sit down!
This way. Hold it this way. Good.
No. We are insane. Who else but crazy men would film their murders? So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there? Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted. We see psychiatrists. They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called? Oh - I got it. Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice. We come out free, rich and famous!
Good idea!
Okay. He has nothing to say. Start the camera!
Cut!
You are success story? I am success story! Why do you say I and not we?
Oleg, don't be paranoid. You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you? I gave you half of what they gave me. Look - here we are!
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
The one who got caught in the bathroom. George Michael.
I'm serious.
Shut up. Look!
This is my project. I say 'action.' I am the director! You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.' And 'action!'
Bad last moment - I cut it out.
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
Be quiet. Watch.
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
Because I am the director. Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
Because I am the director. Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.

Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
CONTINUED
I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
CONTINUED
She's wonderful.
CONTINUED
Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
CONTINUED
How did they manage to do that without any communication?
CONTINUED
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
CONTINUED
We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
Right. Just a sec.
Right. Just a sec.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, come on down.
Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
Sure, what is it?
Sure, what is it?
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
What's up?

It's about my salary cheques.
It's about my salary cheques.
Yes?
Yes?
Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.
That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.
Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
Really.
Really.
Yes.
Yes.
Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
It's possible.
It's possible.
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.

No. I never did, either.
I suppose the idea was specialized training.
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.

Oh?
Oh?
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
That seems very unlikely.
That seems very unlikely.
Yes, I thought so.
Yes, I thought so.
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.

How?

Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
That's true.
Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.

But not completely inconceivable?

I suppose it isn't logically impossible.

I guess it isn't.

Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
Well, that's something.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.

Good morning. How's it going?
Are you reasonably awake?
Are you reasonably awake?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
You're kidding.
You're kidding.
No.
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Two more.
Two more.
Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
Hal?
Yes.
It's the last one.
Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.

I guess not.

I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.

Roger.
I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
He's got a point.
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
What is it, Hal?
What is it, Hal?
MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.
Sure, Dave, what's up?
Sure, Dave, what's up?
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?

Yes, I know.
Yes, I know.
You probably also know that we found them okay.
You probably also know that we found them okay.
Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.
Hal, is there anything bothering you? Anything that might account for this problem?
Hal, is there anything bothering you? Anything that might account for this problem?
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
Well, don't worry about it.
Well, don't worry about it.
And don't you worry about it.
And don't you worry about it.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Yes, it is, Hal.
Yes, it is, Hal.
Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
Yes, it is.
I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
The antenna has to be replaced.
The antenna has to be replaced.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.

It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.
If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.
I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.

Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
I am prepared to do that anyway.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.

Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection.
CONTINUED
Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
CONTINUED
Did they have any explanation for this?
CONTINUED
Well, what is it?
CONINUED
Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
CONTINUED
Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
CONTINUED
Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
I'm having a party tomorrow.
Yes, I know that sweetheart.

Well, how's it going back there?
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.

Well, where are all of you off to?
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
Well, that does sound very odd.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June.
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
How do you do, Mr. Miller?
I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
Please, it really doesn't matter.

Are you quite sure?
Are you quite sure?
Yes, really, thank you very much.
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
Really?
Really?
Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?

I see.
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Fortunately, they did.
Fortunately, they did.
Well, I'm glad about that.
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
Certainly.
Certainly.
Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened?
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?
I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.

Any clue as to what it is?
Any clue as to what it is?
Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
Any ideas about the colour?
Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?

There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.

Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
Thank you.
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.

I see.
I see.
I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I've heard that ten people have died already.
Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable.
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.

I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.
Let me see the tracking alignment display.
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.

What's the matter with my place?
What's the matter with my place?
No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
Here's hoping, baby...
Hello, again.
I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business. As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
Here you go, baby.
Hey, don't do that. I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
Hey, don't do that. I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
Hey, no, I'm tryin' to be nice. Buy yourself something pretty. I'd do it, but I got to go. I got this cop waitin' for me...

Now you're talkin'. See ya...
I said police. Now drop the goddamn gun.
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
How about it?
I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is. I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will. He owes me money...
I hear you've got visitors.
Would you guys...
Would you guys...
No time for any of that crap any more, lady... I'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast.
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
Yeah. Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
Yeah. Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
You're gonna help us take him.
You're gonna help us take him.
No chance.
No chance.
He can live or die ... You let us in and he's got a chance to make it. Otherwise, he gets ventilated.
Where's ganz?
In the back. Down the other corridor.
You lying son of a bitch...
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
I don't think you're gonna make it.
I don't think you're gonna make it.
Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...
I got hit. I can't believe it. I got shot.
You're done. End of story.
You're done. End of story.
I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
You got a name, cop?
Try Cates. And let's talk in private, okay?
Try Cates. And let's talk in private, okay?
Sure, anything you want.
You here to write my life story?
Not likely, Reggie. Maybe I just need some help.
Yeah, I noticed...
Ganz is in jail. He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
Ganz is in jail. He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
Didn't work out that way. He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.
Yeah?
I can deliver Ganz. But you gotta get me outta here first.
I can deliver Ganz. But you gotta get me outta here first.
You're crazy.
You're crazy.
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out. I got to be on the street. Get me outta here.
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out. I got to be on the street. Get me outta here.
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
I got a lot to protect.
I got a lot to protect.
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
I'll think about it.
This prison gives out $400 suits?
What are you talkin' about? This suit's mine. It cost $900.
We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...
Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
Hey, no way. Take off the bracelets or no deal.
You just don't get it, do your Reggie? There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
You just don't get it, do your Reggie? There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
No way to start a partnership.
No way to start a partnership.
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead. And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead. And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Shit. I'm already sorry.
Yeah.
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
Okay, let's get down to it. I did my part and got you out. So now you tell me where we're goin'?
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit. We go to him right away.
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit. We go to him right away.
Luther was part of the gang?

What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
I don't give a damn. It happens to be my name.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
I may call you worse than that.
Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
I'm helpin' you, huh?
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
Hey, this works pretty good.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Want to try it again?
What do you think?
I think you better put him on ice, man.
I think you better put him on ice, man.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim. And you fucked' it up.
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim. And you fucked' it up.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
We eat when I say we eat.
We eat when I say we eat.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here. If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye. And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...

Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population. She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
Now, where we goin', convict?
Mission District. Gonna find us an Indian.
I don't give out the details.
Last night, two nights ago, three?
Last night.
You have a good time?
Sure. Then we had a fight this morning.
At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her. She got great tits?
Well?
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.

This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
Back you up? Now why would I wanna do that?

If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...

But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
Bullshit. Attitude and experience get you through...
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
You need five years training to handle a joint like...
Hey, you wanna bet?
I got two problems. Number one, I'm not playin' games. Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
I got two problems. Number one, I'm not playin' games. Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
Why? Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
Why? Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
That's never been one of my problems.
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
What are you talkin' about?
What are you talkin' about?
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail. And whatever it is, you're part of it.
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail. And whatever it is, you're part of it.
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
The bet's off.
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
You made that move, huh?
While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.
There.
Must be billy's girl.
Must be billy's girl.
Come on.
Let's go.
Wait a minute. Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us. How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
This sucks. A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.
You wanna leave, man? Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
You wanna leave, man? Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
You? Don't make me laugh. You can't take care of shit. You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt. All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
You? Don't make me laugh. You can't take care of shit. You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt. All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about. I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
Yeah, right. You want to try again?
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
They saved your ass, convict.
They saved your ass, convict.
One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
I been waiting a long time for some money.
How much?
How much?
Half a million.
Half a million.
Jesus.
Just tell me about the money.
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.

He's after your money.
He's after your money.
You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?
We split 50-50?
Not likely, convict.
Not likely, convict.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
You gonna let me keep any of it?
Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
Where's the money?
In the trunk of a car. A lot better than under a mattress, right?
Right, partner.
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Yeah. Right.
Where's the goddamn car?
You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
...For three years? Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
...For three years? Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
You just drove by it.
You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
Shit.
You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.
Not really. I figured Ganz was put down for a long time. And I knew Luther would never job me on his own. He's too chickenshit.
Not really. I figured Ganz was put down for a long time. And I knew Luther would never job me on his own. He's too chickenshit.
Guess what? Luther just got in line.
What?
Musta got some primo bondsman.
Musta got some primo bondsman.
Jesus Christ. That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours. I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.
Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd just leave town.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd just leave town.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
I let women get to me. The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em. Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money. They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
I let women get to me. The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em. Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money. They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
That ain't philosophy. That's common sense.
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...
Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.
A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...
Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...
You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
No class...
No class...
Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
That was in style a couple years back, man.
Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
You stay with me...
You stay with me...
No way...
Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.
I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?
Where's luther?
Be polite. Say hello. This is Candy.
Be polite. Say hello. This is Candy.
Hello. And goodbye.
What about Luther?
What about Ganz?
We missed.
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
Let him get some sleep. He's going to need it.
They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the "Don't Disturb" sign. He's trading his girl for the money. All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.
So you took the rest of the night off...
Tell me something. Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
You sure that's the reason?
Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
Yeah. Guess not.
Yeah, I see her.
I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel. All I need is some money for the room.
That was quick.
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Why?
Why?
Luther's on the move...
Notice something funny about that bus?
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
Hey, how'd my car get here?
I had it impounded. Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
I had it impounded. Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
Back to jail in my own car. Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
Back to jail in my own car. Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one. It'll be my good-bye present.
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
Naw, you didn't let me down. It was a long shot all the way. We gave 'em a good run at it.
Naw, you didn't let me down. It was a long shot all the way. We gave 'em a good run at it.
Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.
It's late, they're closing...
Don't worry about it.
Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend. I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...
Yeah, too bad. They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...
Do I get to kiss her too?
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit? I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.
I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
Hey, there she is...
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine. You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine. You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
Partnership?
Partnership?
Well, you got to admit we come a long way.
You okay?
Yeah. But I wasn't there for a second.
Yeah. But I wasn't there for a second.
You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.
Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.
Wait a minute, Cates. I've been waitin' three years for that. I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
There's nothin' to talk about.
It's your money. It'll be here in six months when you get out.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
Thanks.
No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook? Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
Yeah, I read the report...
Hey, the bastard's got my gun. I want it back.
Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
Yeah...
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Yeah. It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
Yeah. It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
Okay. You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine. Nail this guy and make us all look good. But you better watch your ass. If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
Okay. You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine. Nail this guy and make us all look good. But you better watch your ass. If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
Jack?
Jack?
Yeah?
Yeah?
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
I'll keep it in mind.
What the bell happened?
I lost them, that's what happened.
I lost them, that's what happened.
How did they get away?
How did they get away?
They ran. As fast as they could. Caught a train.
Which one pulled the trigger?
The Indian. I was about 30 yards away.
The Indian. I was about 30 yards away.
You couldn't get to him?
What a screw-up.
Right. I screwed up. I fucked up. I messed up. Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
I didn't have the time.
I didn't have the time.
Too bad, it would've covered your ass. Now you're in the shit and so's the department. In case you haven't noticed, this wasn't our finest hour... I told you everyone was watchin' on this one. Maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike.
He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.
Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.
Where the Christ do you think you're going?
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
+++$+++ That's what you say, Cates...
Yeah.
Yeah.
+++$+++ But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
+++$+++ But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?

Are you gonna tell me about police procedure? Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure? Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
+++$+++ I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
Every last bit of it. The big guy's room was empty.
Every last bit of it. The big guy's room was empty.
I'll help you out.
This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.
Shit.
Billy Bear...
Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
Who are all these?
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.

Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong. He was in on the same job.
Tell me that's not the same guy.
Hey ... Dick Tracy.
I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking. Can we find them?
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.

You look awful.
So do you...been a long day.
So do you...been a long day.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.

Nothing.
Bullshit red tape.
I'm heading out. How about you?
I got to wait for a call.
Okay. See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
I almost forgot. That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
What?
Jesus Christ. Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
I'm not paid to take your personal calls. He was in some bar. .. off duty.
A cop...
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?

Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.

You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
Who gives a fuck what you think?
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
I think I met her. Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
I think I met her. Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
I don't know.
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
When? How?
When? How?
I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
What am I wanted for?
I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
I don't think your gun's loaded...
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?

I still don't think it's loaded.
Hey, you're right.
You're hopeless.
You're hopeless.
That's the way I see it, too.
I'm all wet.
What's wrong with that?
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
What'd you do?
What'd you do?
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.

I guess he got the message...

Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch. I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...

I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.
What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
Maybe you ought to buy me one.
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.

When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.

That's the way I see it, too.

Jack, are you okay?
Jack, are you okay?
Sure, okay, fine, no problem... See, there's this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ...
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
Bullshit? I'll tell you about bullshit. My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it. It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...

That's right. I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him. Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...

I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don't like it.
Just one. Some lady called. Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
I'm at work, asshole. Where else?
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.

Just a second, that's all!
Hello.

I can see that. Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit. What happened?
We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
You real down?
I've been better...Dead end. No Ganz, no Indian.
Nothing. No sign of Ganz. No sign of the Indian. Airport's clean. Train station. Bus station. Docks... Shit...
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...

How do you know?
How do you know?
Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type. But this Indian...
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions. I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.

When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.

Whaddya think?

What do I know? I'm just a bartender.
Let's go, Reggie.
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
Usual bullshit. You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.

He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.
You're impossible...
That's what I always say.
Who the hell are you?
Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years. And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...

Hey, two days with him is enough.
Hey, two days with him is enough.
That's no bull.
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me. The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend. Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
Hey...
Shut up.
Shut up.
What the hell's wrong? I didn't do anything.
What do you want? What's goin' on?
Shut up.
Stall.
What do you want?
Keep stallin'.
Alright, I'm coming...hold on.

Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...
Come on, you can trust me. Please.
You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.
Let her go.
First, the money.
Rosalie, you okay?
What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
How you doing, man?
Not bad, not bad.
You want to go outside?
Naw, right here's okay.

...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
Ah, Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain...
...would you like a drink?
No thank you.
No thank you.
Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.
...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color. So full of..life!
They are robots!
Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life! So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.
You are a monster, Zorg!
I know...
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.
That's me. But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?

She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
I know. I was there when she arrived.
Excuse me! Just one thing! She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
It means, "Never without my permission".
It means, "Never without my permission".
That's what I thought.
I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
What kind of mission?

We have to save the world.

Good luck..
Good luck..
Of course.
Of course.
Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
What are you doing?
Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
Leeloo's in trouble?
Leeloo's in trouble?
When is she not in trouble?
When is she not in trouble?
Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?
Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
That's what I'm saying.
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
One more reason to shoot first eh?
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
That's exactly what we are going to try and do: Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens! General? You may fire when ready.
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
And then?
And then?
And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.
Is there anything that can stop it?
Yes..thank God..
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
White turns to black. Light to Dark. Life to Death. For all eternity.
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop? You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
Thank you, Mr. President.
What are we going to do?
This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
It's a miracle!!!
What is?
What is?
I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!
Father, will you please explain what's going on?
The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!
Father. You sure she's the Supreme Being?
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
What's she doing?
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
Yes. Of course..
There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...
I didn't know your size.
They really made her...
Perfect.
I got it! Everything here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
Good work, my son. Now all we need is a way to get there.
Where's Leeloo?
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
It's all my fault. I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...
Who?
Who?
The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...
Leeloo... is... she's...
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
...So Cornelius was telling the truth!
She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
Do you love her?
Do you love her?
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
I don't have time... I need to know.
I don't have time... I need to know.
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
I would like to have died in peace...
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
They are... with me...
Yeah?
Hey bud! Finger here.
I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.

+++$+++ You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it. I'd like to take your picture. You don't mind?
I'd rather you didn't.
I'd rather you didn't.

Those are two different kinds of trust. Thank you for your time. I hope we can do business.

Machine's in?
Machine's in?
+++$+++ He's in. It will be his pleasure.
Where's that?
+++$+++ Brooklyn. Don't be late.
+++$+++ You brought the money?
Right here.
+++$+++ Excellent.
Where are the women?

+++$+++ Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
What are you... ?
What are you... ?
+++$+++ Take out your gun!
+++$+++ Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
Look, I don't know what this...
Look, I don't know what this...
+++$+++ Shut up, cunt! Do exactly as I say, or I'll put this arrow through your throat.
+++$+++ You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
I remember him.
+++$+++ Friend of yours?
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...

+++$+++ Bring the film, or we kill him.
I'll get it. It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
+++$+++ How cooperative. Longdale will keep you company.
Is that him?
+++$+++ Put the gun down, take the handcuffs. Handcuff yourself to the bed.
+++$+++ Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.
Move it, dirtbag... !
You're a dead man.
+++$+++ Leave him alone.
+++$+++ Leave him alone.
Fuck off.
... sorry...
+++$+++ First things first. You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
You got the guts, tough guy? Gonna kill us all, is that it?
+++$+++ You betrayed us.
What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
Call me Tom.

Alright, Tom.
Alright, Tom.

Absolutely. Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...
Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife. What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe. They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city. Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone. Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself... That's the last they saw her. The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch... They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?

This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved. They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever. Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.

Well, that's all I can do. Sorry.

Okay, we'll come back to that. So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it. It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.

Fuck you then, you want to know? I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star. I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey. When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it. That's what happened. She's dead. She's been dead a long fucking time. Nobody fucking cares!
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.

Yes, I do have something to say. I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
I'm listening.

As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.

Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.
You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.

Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name. Her mom remembers her.
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one. Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...

... Hello... ?
Wake up, pops. Your education begins tonight.
You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc. Nobody even considers them pornography anymore. Then, there's mainstream hardcore. Triple X. The difference is penetration. That's hardcore. That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are. They pump out 150 videos a week. A week. They've even got a porno Academy Awards. America loves pornography. Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying. Somebody's buying those videos. Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex. Know what else? It's only gonna get worse. More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution. Desensitization. Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive! Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out. Know what I mean? For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while. They have to be the biggest tits ever. Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally. Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.

Child pornography.
Child pornography.
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal. Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal. This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love. Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line. How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not? Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn. Rape films, but there aren't many. I've never seen one.

What other ways are there to get illegal films? Who do you see?
First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer. It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet. Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants. It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em. But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes. No one knows where it comes from. That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth. Those are zombies, hardcore junkies. Their hands are permanently pruned. They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister. Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes. Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations. Interstate wire transfers. Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows? That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal. There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is.

You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
It's their Presidential Suite.

Great.
Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?
It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?
Wha... ?
Who is this, in the mask? Who is he?
Who is he?
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...

Who is he, his name?
Who is he, his name?
Nobody knows his name. That's his thing. He always wears a mask. You never see his face. He calls himself "Machine," that's what they call him. Machine.
You don't need to be here.
What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?
I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."
"Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
What's next?
I'm trying to figure that out myself. I have to see Machine without his mask.

Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
Nope.
What's this?
It's money. People use it to purchase goods and services.
Look... that's awful generous and everything...
It's not my money. The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought. Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay? Go be a race car driver. Go run for President. Whatever.
+++$+++ Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
I try to be.
Uh huh, pleasure.
+++$+++ Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
+++$+++ Have a pleasant evening. Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
Thank you.
He's odd.
+++$+++ He's a lawyer. Please, sit, here...
+++$+++ I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey. Asking about you. I must say you have friends in influential places.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.

My condolences.

+++$+++ His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma. A terrible, terrible dilemma.

I'll do whatever I can to help.
Pittsburgh?
+++$+++ Mostly. That's where he started his empire building. He was a good man. Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated. He wanted to be legendary.

He succeeded.
He succeeded.
+++$+++ We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine. We had our troubles. There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him. I loved him deeply.
+++$+++ Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to. Other than that, there's never any reason.

+++$+++ Just curious.
+++$+++ My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe. I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business. Not till now, that is.
You hired someone to open it. I'll bet the lawyer loved that.

+++$+++ Cash, stock certificates, and this...
+++$+++ It's a film... of a girl being murdered.
I'm afraid I don't...
I'm afraid I don't...
+++$+++ This is a movie showing a girl being murdered. She's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife... I only watched what I could.
+++$+++ I didn't know what to think. I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband. To know that he watched this... this atrocity. But, I can't go to the police...
Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment? I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a "snuff film." But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth. Like, red light district folklore. There's no such thing, I can assure you.
Please, believe me. This is probably a stag film. Simulated rape. Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...
+++$+++ No.
+++$+++ No.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...

I'm sure it is. It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke. More than likely he never even watched it.

You... you need to go to the police.
+++$+++ I told you I can't, not yet.
+++$+++ I told you I can't, not yet.
You don't have any other choice.
You don't have any other choice.
+++$+++ No. For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police. I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...

It won't work like that.
It won't work like that.
+++$+++ Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously. I've thought about it and there's no other way. If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen. I'm telling you I won't. If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.
I deal in divorce cases. Corporate investigations...
+++$+++ You've found missing persons before.

+++$+++ I know what I'm asking. Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk. You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it. I feel responsible, Mr. Welles. You saw what he did to her.
Okay...
+++$+++ My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.

I'm here.
+++$+++ Do you think the film could have cost that much?

For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations. Who knows? It sure could have. I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.

Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit. If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.
+++$+++ I don't understand, who are... ?
+++$+++ I don't understand, who are... ?
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington. I'm sure you've dealt with them before?

+++$+++ Yes, but...
+++$+++ Yes, but...
These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations... ... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different. I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually. I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh...
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
+++$+++ Neil... Neil Cole.
+++$+++ Neil... Neil Cole.
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me. He didn't call?
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me. He didn't call?
+++$+++ No.
+++$+++ No.
Well, I'm following up on your daughter, Mary, height; five four, weight; hundred ten pounds, brown eyes, blonde hair. Born April 24, 1976. Missing June 11th, 1992. A runaway, that's how she's listed. Is this information correct... ?
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations. It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts. All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.
+++$+++ They hired you. You're like, a private detective?
+++$+++ They hired you. You're like, a private detective?
That's exactly what I am.
+++$+++ I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.
You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat. Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh? And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
So, she didn't leave a note? She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
+++$+++ No.
+++$+++ No.
She just seemed... depressed... ?
She just seemed... depressed... ?
+++$+++ She didn't seem herself. For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it. One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone. She took some clothes.

+++$+++ No one knows what it's like. You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
+++$+++ People remember me from the news. Can you drive me back now?
Of course.
I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time. Maybe we can finish tomorrow. I'll call tomorrow...
+++$+++ Okay.
+++$+++ Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother. Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time. That's when you start going to church.
We're all like that.
We're all like that.
+++$+++ Are you religious?
+++$+++ Are you religious?
No.
No.
+++$+++ You should be.
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
+++$+++ What?
+++$+++ What?
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons. When kids run, they almost always leave a note. It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.

It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it. She might have wanted to tell you something...

+++$+++ No. You don't have any reason to think that...
If the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place.
+++$+++ How... how can you say that to me...?
Will you let me look?
Will you let me look?

You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go. Police are just as human as you or I. They could have missed something. They probably didn't. Wouldn't you rather know?
You were right. I didn't find anything. I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?
+++$+++ Yes.
+++$+++ I think about it everyday. But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.
It's been six years.
It's been six years.
+++$+++ What am I supposed to do? Forget her? Time heals all wounds, right? She's all I think about, and I've learned to live with that. But, you want the truth... the real truth? If I had a choice... if I had to choose, between her being out there, living a good life and being happy, and me not knowing; never finding out what happened to her... ... or her being dead and me knowing... I'd choose to know.

You... you do? You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...

What is this?
Those are her belongings.
Those are her belongings.

Her belongings?
That's her suitcase. I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet. Oh, I adored her. I supposed I always hoped she'd be back. After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things. Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?

I'll do what I can.
Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night. The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman. It's unpleasant, I know. I apologize...
None too discreet, is he?

No, sir, he is not.

He's an imbecile. I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?

Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.

Excellent. we accept MasterCard and American Express.

Alright. May I have your phone number, area code first?
No, you may not.
No, you may not.
Okay. Fine.
I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of...
Yeah, I know the spiel. If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
Yeah, I know the spiel. If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.

Yeah, or turn you into toast.
I can't go back to sleep again.
I haven't slept much either. Since Kristen...
We'll figure it out.
Figure it out?!?! I'll be insane before I figure it out. The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep. Not while he's using me.

Have you seen Joey and Kincaid! God, I can't find them. I can't find them anywhere.

I'm sure they're around.

You could do worse.
My mom taught me when I was little. Did you ever hear of the dream master?
Sounds like a game show host to me.

I daydream. you have to dream about some place fun. Remember you're in control.
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
You what?
When I used to have nightmares. I brought my friends in to help me. Until they all started dying.
Kristen, what happened?
You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
You in a hurry?
I gotta get to the library before it closes. Killer physics test.

I thought it was an accident. Smoking in bed.
It was no suicide. It was not an accident. It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
I was there in the dream. He took her. It was awful. It was awful...
"In her dream"?
No, don't! I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
Kristen's story really got to her.
I've been working double shifts.
Extra money, huh?

Look, you know why, you just don't believe me.
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
How long have you been awake?
Three days.
Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy. Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me. Someone to bring them to him.
Not really.
Is there something we can do?
Is there something we can do?
I don't think so. I guess this is my own war.
You don't really get it. He's not a nightstalker. It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
Yeah, right. Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room. Adults won't see it. They can't.
Yeah, right. Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room. Adults won't see it. They can't.
Then what else can we do?
Then what else can we do?
Try what other kids did. Keep each other awake. We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
Try what other kids did. Keep each other awake. We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
Who?
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
Hey, you're not alone. We have to stop him, I'm with you.
Hey, you're not alone. We have to stop him, I'm with you.
You just feel sorry for me.
You just feel sorry for me.
Cut that shit out. Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side.
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
It's okay, we're just about there.
He's going after Debbie. I gotta stop him.
You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
Here we are.
Something's wrong here. It feels like...
What the hell was that?
Debbie. She's gone. I've...collected her, like the others.
You look great!
Save it for later. Come on!
Rick, please.
Alright, I think I see salvation...
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
Give her time. Beauty is skin deep.
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack? She was gonna be a doctor.
It was Freddy.
It was Freddy.
Enough of that crap.
Enough of that crap.
I saw it. It was my dream. I brought Sheila in...
T-T-Thanks Alice...
Earth to Alice...
Hey, Rick!
Excuse me, ladies. I'll just be a moment.
I don't get it.
Let me talk to you.
So what's up? What'd I miss?
She told us the story of Freddy. It's a town legend. He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.

So?
So?
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.

Nice neighborhood.
Nice neighborhood.
Now it gets weird. She says he comes back in dreams. If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
Hey man, we're all sorry...
She knew she was gonna die.
Been up with Alice.
How she doing? I ran into her last night.
How she doing? I ran into her last night.
She's blaming herself for Sheila. I know how it feels. I've been thinking about Kristen. Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.

About Freddy?
About Freddy?
What else? You ever look over this town's history? Not a safe place to be a teenager. Anyway, if I'm next, watch your back.
Something the matter with the cuisine?
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
You're just tired. Don't think I haven't noticed your not sleeping. That has to stop, honey.
What's wrong with me?
Your distraught. It'll help...
I'm sorry honey, but...
Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!

Honey, we went over this in therapy.
Honey, we went over this in therapy.
Mother, you've just murdered me. Take that to your goddamn therapy...
Something wrong with the stairs?
Avoid-all-contact-day.
Avoid-all-contact-day.
What?
What?
When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
What is it?
Oh God! He killed them!
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
It's no story. It happened. Freddy's real and he's back.
I'll tell you later.
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
It's okay, babe. We're with you.
It's okay, babe. We're with you.
I told you you can't help. This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
Feeling better now?
Yeah. I guess so... What happened?
Yeah. I guess so... What happened?
You had a nasty bump.
I gotta get out of here.
You just stay put. You need rest.
You just stay put. You need rest.
You don't get it, he's after me...
You don't get it, he's after me...
Don't worry, honey
+++$+++ Excuse us, dear.
It's okay, Dan
+++$+++ Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?
What I what? Well, I've thought about it. I plan to keep him.
Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no. He is my responsibility.
+++$+++ And ours. It's our grandchild.
+++$+++ In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
What are you talking about? My "condition"?...
+++$+++ We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
You're not taking my baby!
Hey...wake up.
Huh?
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
It's lonely in there, in my room.
It's lonely in there, in my room.
My name is...
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
How did you know that?
How did you know that?
I could tell you were sad. I just wanted to see if you were all right.
Hi, you don't look very well. Are you feeling all right?
Been having bad dreams.
Is that who you're waiting for?
No...
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be. Maybe we should go find your Mom.
She doesn't want me around
She doesn't want me around
Oh...I'm sure that's not true. I'll bet she's very worried about you. I would be.
No you're not. You don't even care about being a mom. How come you don't think about me?
Who said I...wait, what?
Who says I don't like you?
My friend, with the funny hand.
Mommy...?
Come on downstairs. He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
Where is he?
He's inside you, where he hides.
What do you mean?
It's where he hides out. Inside. That's how he found me.
But how...?
He says it's easy. Especially with sad people. With closed-off people.
Hi, beautiful.
Jesus! Don't do that!
Jesus! Don't do that!
Sorry, babe.
The tickets.
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris. It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris. It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
I know.
Okay, babe. What's the matter?
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
He'll show up. C'mon, what's really wrong?
About him?
No. Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control. For the first time since...all that. I'm scared.
You stopped it didn't you? It was probably just a regular bad dream.
Yeah...I guess.
Yeah...I guess.
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you. Or me. Or us. Remember...
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you. Or me. Or us. Remember...
You're right.
You're right.
There you go. Love you.
There you go. Love you.
Me too.
I was afraid you weren't coming.
+++$+++ I watched from behind the stands. Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know. "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
+++$+++ I watched from behind the stands. Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know. "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
That's in the past. Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
That's in the past. Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
+++$+++ No. A deal's a deal.
Dad!
+++$+++ It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
+++$+++ Where are we going?
To take a picture.
Thanks for everything, Dad.
+++$+++ You sure you don't want a ride to work?
+++$+++ You sure you don't want a ride to work?
It's just across the park.
+++$+++ I'm so sorry, honey...
Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back. Make them understand.
How was the meeting?
+++$+++ Sobering...
+++$+++ Sobering...
Very funny.
Very funny.
+++$+++ Alice...
+++$+++ Alice...
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
+++$+++ Since my little girl became a mom...
+++$+++ Since my little girl became a mom...
You disappointed in me?
You disappointed in me?
+++$+++ No, I'm not. I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
+++$+++ Alice!
I've got to go.
I've got to go.
+++$+++ No! I won't have you running around in the middle of the night. You're coming home.
+++$+++ No! I won't have you running around in the middle of the night. You're coming home.
But Dad --
But Dad --
+++$+++ Now.
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
Had kind of a long night.
Had kind of a long night.
Dan keeping you up again? Put a lock on that window, girl.
Dan keeping you up again? Put a lock on that window, girl.
No, the Dan part was nice...
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey. I've got to go find Dan.
Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
It was no accident. It was Krueger. He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore. He's found some other way.
Alice, it's no dream. I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
Have you visited the little boy on my floor? Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?
There aren't any little boys on your floor.
There aren't any little boys on your floor.
He must've wandered up from the children's ward. I just wondered what was wrong with him.
Did everyone call everyone?
They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
What's that got to do with it?
When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so. End of story.
It was just an accident. Like with Dan.
No accident. I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?
Why don't you two stick to reality.
You had me scared on the phone. What's wrong with the baby?
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
Oh, Alice...no. Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...
Mark knows I'm not crazy. Ask him to show you his hands.
I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you. But, you're like a locked safe. You've gotta start dealing with reality.
Krueger is reality.
Krueger is reality.
And so is your baby. You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
And so is your baby. You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
What do you think I'm doing? Look. Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back. He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman. Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?
Goddamn it, Yvonne! You don't just run away from this guy! He finds you in your dreams.
Look...we're all tired. None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
That's the only reason you're alive...
Are you alright?
Yeah...So that's him. And you're not crazy.
You think that's the place she's buried?
If they actually bothered to bury her.
What?
Jacob. We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
But how are we gonna --
We've got to go to the asylum and find her body. Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me. It must be!
You do good work, Alice.
So did Dan.
He sure loves to stay awake.
That's okay. He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
I think I'm starting to wear her down. Have some anyway.
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
Greta, come on. One burger with me?
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
Well we gotta do something!
I've got to write some of this down.
That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
Mark, are you okay?
Yeah. I'm just aces.
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta. And...
I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today. Could we interest you in someone else?
I thought about that.
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
Then get out!
Mark!
Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?
Nobody thinks that.
Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.
It wasn't her mother. The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
Why don't I go make some coffee. There's a lot to tell.
Who's Jacob?
My baby!
My baby!
What, you named it already?
Whoa, slow down. How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?
I don't know!
Where are you going?
I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
I couldn't do that, Mark. He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.
Then we'll find another way.
They think I'm nuts.
That's their problem.
No, it's our problem, Mark. If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob. You said she committed suicide?
That's what the newspapers thought. She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
That's what the newspapers thought. She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
Meaning?
They couldn't prove it. No body! Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
But I've seen her grave.
But I've seen her grave.
Empty plot. Memorial stone. Vacant. They never did put her under. Cool, huh?
Poor woman...
No shit.
I don't understand.
She killed herself. Her soul's gonna be in torment.
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
Next life. Oh, what's that?
Next life. Oh, what's that?
My undying love. Have some.
Meet me later. Milkshakes. Cherry pie. Banana splits. And no mom!
Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.
You know my mother -- get real. What about Alice's?
He's right. Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.
Who?
Who?
Oh, he was this ancient guy I read about who like, killed his kids 'cause they didn't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should.
Oh man! I could've gone all night without looking at that.
I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
These things are wild... What do you think?
Makes you look like a nun--
All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do. I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...
Yeah...
Yeah...
That means they're gonna give me the key to the pool so I can lock up when I'm done.
Have another one, sounds like you need it.
Naah, I'm done. Got to be on shift in a couple hours. Aren't you going in?
Naah, I'm done. Got to be on shift in a couple hours. Aren't you going in?
Nah. It's getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair. She's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night.
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
I want to talk about the baby.
Look. Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard. He was bitching about it at the party last night. He was under pressure. We all are.
Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
Bottom line, Alice. Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.
All of us. Right?
Dan. And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne. You've been practicing.
Two hours a day, six days a week.
Vomit?
Faint.
Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!
Mark...
Mark...
I'm not finished - I loved Greta. A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
I'm not finished - I loved Greta. A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
I can't listen to this.
It's okay.
Stick around, please?
You, too?
He invited me to his house last night.
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.' I thought it was your father.
It was supposed to be. Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
It was supposed to be. Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
How is he - ?
How is he - ?
It was moderate. He'll be all right. But it was out of the question, his coming along.
It was moderate. He'll be all right. But it was out of the question, his coming along.
And they thought <u>you</u> could re- place the Skipper?
You could train someone else.
Not in two days. Look: Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come? If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!
What is it?
Your 'out.' This came for you.
Your 'out.' This came for you.
My father! He's not - ?
My father! He's not - ?
Dead? Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
What did you mean: I'm 'out?'
Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow. We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you? Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!
<u>You</u> said it. But I won't argue -
Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>! It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
That may be. But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
That may be. But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
Perhaps. But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!

You may not <u>win</u> them. But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!
Unidentified Flying Objects.
Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
That's enough, Holloway. I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !
- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward! And it happens you've got no choice: Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -
I'd sooner swim!
They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars. But now - I wonder -
Yes?
Yes?
Which is the one - we have to worry about?
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.
But if they <u>do</u>?
But if they <u>do</u>?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I wouldn't worry. So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
I wouldn't worry. So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
And his 'egghead' son! We'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won't we?
Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating - What do you think of this husband of yours? On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer. But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work. She deserves a fighting chance!

So they caught up with you, too?

You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!
Huh?
Huh?
I might have a son like <u>that!</u>
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?
I guess.
I guess.
One of the finest men, and officers, alive. A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two. He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.

So?
So?
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist. A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot! 'Ban the atom tests! Junk the nuclear subs! Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist. A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot! 'Ban the atom tests! Junk the nuclear subs! Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
A lot of people think like that.
But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son! It broke his heart. Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy. Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
'His' side? I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
Cyclops?
Sounds like it! Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.
We're stuck tight!
Skipper! Look at the depth gauge!
You've got to let us try, Skipper --
'Us?'
'Us?'
Reef and I can take the Explorer down, clamp it around the eye, and ---
You all wait here. I'm going inside, take a look.
Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.
What's more important - there's our problem. The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!

I think you're right.
I think you're right.
Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
Yeah?
Listen! Hear that?
I don't hear anything. Maybe you've been down here too long. Why don't you go back up and -
Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
Hey - you know somethin'? It's getting lighter in here!
You know - it <u>is</u>?
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
You hear that?
The sound again?
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
Somewhere down there?
Somewhere down there?
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
We'll have to look for them later.
Well?
I'm with <u>you!</u>
Here - keep these. It wants me to come alone.
Oh it does???
Dave - !
What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
Get ready. We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.
Right, Skipper.
Is there any way out of it?
Seems to be all around...
Seems to be all around...
What about down?
What about down?
I...don't know!
Course and speed?
Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!
What???
What course, Skipper?
Right at our one-eyed friend!
You better take Powell and Carney with you --
The frogmen?
The frogmen?
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable. Take sidearms, and flare pistols --

Sidearms? But the saucer's dead.
Sidearms? But the saucer's dead.
We hope!
Excuse me, Skipper---
Yes, Griff?
Yes, Griff?
All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor.
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
Something wrong?
Something wrong?
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.

Why do you say that?

We're dead in the water. But it indicates we're moving!
We're dead in the water. But it indicates we're moving!
What????
We read you! Go ahead, Doctor! They're inside the saucer. It's filled with breathable air!
Wonderful!
Wonderful!
That's wonderful, Carl! Reef thinks they can clear the Shark bow so we can pull ourself loose!
Now they feel it...down below.
Radiation level...constantly rising...
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
Anything ---

It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.

What about time...?
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
+++$+++ Under <u>water</u>?
+++$+++ Under <u>water</u>?
High-intensity arcs will burn, submerged. And millions of volts...discharged in random directions...
+++$+++ ...above Murmansk, and Finland.
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
+++$+++ What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate a bit? Perhaps be lying there waiting - ?
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear. But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?
+++$+++ <u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force. Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....

The North Pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all - the Earth itself!
+++$+++ ....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it.... ...'recharging his batteries'?
If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
+++$+++ What direction does the system indicate?
+++$+++ As we near the Pole...
There's got to be an explanation!
There's got to be an explanation!
+++$+++ There is. I believe our friend...Cyclops... is returning to life!
+++$+++ All ready?
As ready as we <u>can</u> be! I'll report to the Skipper.
Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.
I did go. Just back. Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent. My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
I did go. Just back. Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent. My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
I met Dr. Kent, once.
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef - You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
Who with?
Who with?
Dr. Neilsen. He'll be - -
'Doctor' Neilsen? When did <u>that</u> happen?
Huh?
Huh?
It'll be all right. We're old friends!
What do you think?
I think I should have joined the Air Force!
Determine extent of damage, immediately.
After torpedo room: Report!
You're sure it's Cyclops?
Take a look.
What's the running time?
Thirty-four seconds!
Right <u>at</u> him?
That's what I said!
That's what I said!
But - what can we accomplish?
But - what can we accomplish?
We can <u>ram</u> him!
A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....
It's the screws, Skipper. At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
It's the screws, Skipper. At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
And we're at safe maximum depth already.... Stop engines!
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
What?
What?
If we could get inside the saucer - use our torches - maybe we could cut the Shark loose?
Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!
Nothing we can do, now.
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
Minus three.
+++$+++ Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!
Come where?
That's a <u>face</u>???
+++$+++ Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
+++$+++ Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
Tell me something: Why can <u>I</u> hear you, when the others couldn't?
+++$+++ My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
- for horrors like yourself?
Swell!
+++$+++ Your friend was to remain where he was!
He did!
+++$+++ I am afraid not. Therefore -
Why not me? What am I - the closing act?
+++$+++ On the contrary. I want you - unharmed - perfect.
+++$+++ On the contrary. I want you - unharmed - perfect.
Why?
Why?
+++$+++ I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study. We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'
+++$+++ It is a living thing. When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
+++$+++ Of course. But it is time to be- gin the return voyage --
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
+++$+++ Obviously.
+++$+++ Obviously.
<u>That</u> might be a <u>little</u> <u>rough</u>!
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
+++$+++ Thank you.
See what?
+++$+++ The pattern. Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole. A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
Well, I'll be - !
+++$+++ I'll be another!
+++$+++ Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer. 'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
You plotted the course of Cyclops? Then that's <u>our</u> course! Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!
+++$+++ Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
+++$+++ We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
Due north. At five knots...no, six!
+++$+++ Toward the Pole!
+++$+++ Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
All right - go to it.
You got yourself a computer, Alma.
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?

As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?
What is the Northcountry Development Association?

I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.

All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman. In a year or two, you won't recognize this town.
What are you boys up to?
Same old shit.
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.

Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.

I hear Twombley got shot.

Yeah.
You see it?
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.

This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend. Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade?
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.

It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.

Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks. This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?

There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work. But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.

Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.

I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
Well, I guess I am. I planned this, I planned all this, you know. I mean, it's sort of pathetic, but I planned it. You shouldn't have called your mother. C'mon, we're gonna call her before she leaves.
She's gone already! Gone already! Couldn't wait.

She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Yes.
Yes.
Where do you expect to wait for her? Obviously downstairs with the other kids isn't good enough.
Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
Dad.
I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
Are we going in this?
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.

Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's.
Okay.
Okay.
Fine.
Please don't cry. Please, honey.
What are you sorry for?
What are you sorry for?
I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.

Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
Tomorrow, Gordon.

You mean Twombley?
You mean Twombley?
Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens.
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.

You want me to follow them to Littleton?
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first. He'll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been avoided, I'll put that kid's ass in a sling.
What the fuck. My day's already ruined. Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do.
It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
Something bugging you?
Something bugging you?
Yeah. A few things.
Yeah. A few things.
Well, right now we're not too interested. Finish up what you gotta do, then you can get bugged on your own time.
How you holding up, Wade?
I'm fine, fine.
I'm fine, fine.
You Rolfe? I remember you from high school. You're a teacher now? Harvard?
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
On what you pay me?
On what you pay me?
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
What do I have to do for it?
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.

You and Mel Gordon?

Could be.
Could be.
Always count on old Wade for a good screwing. Why should I always pay more, sell cheap? Why should you guys make all the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right's right.
Wade, you're done. Let me have the shop keys.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves. Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves. Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
The key, Wade.
The key, Wade.
Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure. Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him. I've got to call my brother.
Lillian!
Where's Jill?
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname?
Yeah.
Yeah.
She's grown up some, hasn't she?
She's grown up some, hasn't she?
Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.
I don't want her to go, Lillian.
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
I'm not making it any worse. You are. Me and Jill could've worked this thing out. It's normal, it's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it. Believe it or not. How do you think this makes me look, treating her like some tragic victim or something?
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
We should talk.
We should talk.
We've done all our talking, Wade.
We've done all our talking, Wade.
It's just...
It's just...
Let the past be. I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.
Wait there. She'll be right out. Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?
Yeah, lots.
Yeah, lots.
See. Get your boots.
See. Get your boots.
Hi honey.
No problem. Look, I...
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.

Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.

From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
New hat? Jill's up, I see.
For a while.
For a while.
How's she doing?
How's she doing?
Okay. She's fine.
Okay. She's fine.
You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? I'm off.
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
See you tomorrow, maybe.
See you tomorrow, maybe.
You okay?

I'm sorry about what I said.

Forget it.

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
You don't mean that.
Yeah. I mean that.
Yeah. I mean that.
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.
Call me.
Tonight. Let's get together.
Tonight. Let's get together.
Okay.
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.

I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?
Money.
Jack doesn't need money.
Jack doesn't need money.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.

Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.

But not now.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.
You knew me as a kid.
You knew me as a kid.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.

Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?
I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.

You've been married twice --

I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.

Strange.
Think they're alright?

Of course! I would've heard.
Of course! I would've heard.
How?
How?
I don't know for Christ's sake!
This is nuts.
Wade.

What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
Going somewhere, Margie?
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.

Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.
Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
Pop, for Christ's sake!
You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
You! By Christ, you -- I know you. Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!
You don't know me. You don't know me! So fuck you. Fuck you.
You don't know me. You don't know me! So fuck you. Fuck you.
Nah-nah-naw! You done done finally done it! Like a man done it. Done it right. I love you, you mean sonofabitch!
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?
Love! I'm made of love!
Love! I'm made of love!
Call it what you want.

Everything you know is from me.

Yeah.
Yeah.
Bang!

You and me.
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
Crawl!
Crawl!
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!

I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.

Wade?
Wade?
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?

There was something. It happened up your way.

Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.

Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm calling because I need you to listen. You're supposed to be a smart guy. You're a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot but he did.
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.

Twombley.

No shit.

You think Jack shot him?
You think Jack shot him?
Well, it was an accident.
Well, it was an accident.
They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
Huh?
Huh?
The night before the shooting.
The night before the shooting.
How was she?
How was she?
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.

What happened?

A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know, 'cause of Jill.
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
Yeah, I guess.
Yeah, I guess.
Get some sleep.

I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.

Haven't you already done a bit of that?
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.
What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
No thanks. I don't drink.
No thanks. I don't drink.
Yeah. I forgot.
What about Margie?
What about her?
What about her?
Well, do you still plan to get married?
Well, do you still plan to get married?
Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.

Find them everywhere.
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.

Which is?

That it wasn't an accident.

Then who shot him?

Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.

Motive. You gotta have a motive.

Money.

Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.

They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
I don't know. You tell me.
I don't know. You tell me.
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?

Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.

So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.

A hunting accident is perfect.
A hunting accident is perfect.
Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled.
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?
Not particularly.
Not particularly.
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?

It may have happened, but not the way you said.
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?

It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.

We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.

Well, I never heard that one.
Well, I never heard that one.
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.

That's what you think.
Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another.
Wade, are you alright?
Wade, are you alright?
But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.
I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.
For what?
To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?
Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.
Well, you aren't the President, dear.

Yeah, no duh.
You don't want to say hi to your father?
I'm sure he's busy.

Don't you even want to ask?
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
Alice...

You're jet-lagged. We'll talk about this back...
You're jet-lagged. We'll talk about this back...
Back at The Fishbowl?
We'll talk at home. You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you. For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.
I know, Mom. It was great... really.
He's in a meeting. He can't be disturbed.
I'm sorry, honey.
I'm sorry, honey.
No, it's okay. After all, he is the President, right?
When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.
Your father never means to be so...

I know... But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world. Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh. I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.

I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.

I don't drink coffee.
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.

So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.

That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
Fuck off, you stupid asshole.
It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
He didn't leave us.
You are a resilient man, Mr.
Oooooh, I'm good.
Hey, you guys back already?
How was... ...the ballet?
It was the experience of a lifetime.

How `bout a hug for the old man.

How you doing, sweetie?
Been better, Dad... You?
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
There they are!
Okay, I'm slowing us down.
+++$+++ The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
Did we warn them off?
Did we warn them off?
+++$+++ Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.

You read my mind.

That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
+++$+++ They aren't answering their hails.
This doesn't make sense.
+++$+++ They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.
I prefered the terrorists.

Ms. Mitchell. So nice to finally meet you in person.
The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you. Now if you're all cleared? You can follow me then.
Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth. We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations. We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.
This is a remarkable aircraft.
This is a remarkable aircraft.
You don't know the half of it. Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation? We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.

A dubious distinction, no?
A dubious distinction, no?
I guess it depends on your perspective.
And all these rooms here?
Conference rooms, though some have other functions. The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center.
Here's a press kit. I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.
Thank you.
* Please tell me your name.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell.
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
Scared. We're scared.
You're pointing a gun at me.
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.
What do you want with us?
What do you want with us?
Cooperation. If you try to escape, you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade's bodies will prevent you from exiting. Good day.
Now, or he dies, please.
Come on, Alice.
Leave my daughter alone.
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall? But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall? But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
What do you know of my husband?

I know he left you behind.
I know he left you behind.
My husband is a very courageous man.
My husband is a very courageous man.
Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
Do you have to be so brutal?
Yes
Yes
Why? Do you enjoy it?
Why? Do you enjoy it?
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
How can you? I mean they're people.
But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.
That was war.
That was war.
So is this. Come now, you're upsetting the little one.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
No.
No.
Say something dear.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
Four...
Jim...
Jim...
Three...
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.
Over my dead body.
Over my dead body.
No. But since I only have a few of your staff left to kill, perhaps I will start with your family instead... Gibbs.
She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.
Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
Stop.
You'll do it?
You'll do it?
Yes, I'll do it. Just leave my family alone.
Yes, I'll do it. Just leave my family alone.
Good. Good.
Someday, you'll regret my nature.
You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics, however, that is weakness. You were a hostage to everyone else * long before you were a hostage to
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
One thing I've learned as
There goes your ride.
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
If you put down the gun, I promise not to drop her on the way down.
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
Hold on, Alice.
Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.
+++$+++ Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.

Twenty minutes?
Twenty minutes?
+++$+++ You heard me. You. Congress and cabinet heads.
Madame Vice president. We have an options paper. chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.
+++$+++ Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
Finally, we can bargain.
+++$+++ I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.
+++$+++ Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.
They've gotta be joking.

Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.
Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?
+++$+++ Gravity.
We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.
+++$+++ We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
+++$+++ We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
They've cut communication, and I spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives. My only solution ran out of batteries.
Get `em ready. You... come with me.
+++$+++ Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
+++$+++ Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
Got it.
I'll not going without my family.
+++$+++ Yes, sir.
+++$+++ Sir, we stay with the President.
That isn't necessary.
May I speak to you for a moment?
Can't it wait?
Can't it wait?
No, Mr. President. It can't.
Don't. I know spin control when I feel it.
Rose, I don't have time for this.
For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy. Not even you can plug all the world's leaks. Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.
She's a big girl. She understands.
She's a big girl. She understands.
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already three hours behind Schedule. What do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off because I'm a family man?
You know what?
What?
What?
I miss you. And I miss her.
I miss you. And I miss her.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
I wish it were that easy...
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
This promise isn't subject to Congressional approval.
How did your speech go?
Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
I don't know why you stayed.
Please... don't start with me.
Call Petrov... I'll be back.
Both of you.
What are you doing?
Flying the plane.

You haven't even driven a car since you took office.

No good. I said they disabled the communications system.

No. I thought about this, Mr.

White House Situation room.
Someone should give you a raise.
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
Did they say anything about my family?
+++$+++ They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.

+++$+++ But this is different, sir. You're the President.
+++$+++ Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?
Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that. I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office. We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?
What's going on?

* CBS said they'll give us four minutes. They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
You wanna knock of f?
No, no. I'm fine. What did the Speaker say?
No, no. I'm fine. What did the Speaker say?
He and the NRA don't like the wording.
With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one. Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.
I might still have a few chips left.

You give me ulcers.
That's my job.
Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour. I want to review the Iraq situation.
Yes, sir.
Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.
Okay. Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
Shepherd.
Sir...
My god. I think that was a MiG.
A MiG? Where the hell are we?

They better. Fuel's almost gone.
IT'S OPEN!
DO YOU SEE TEEM?
WE'RE HOOKED!
We're hooked. Hove into position.
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
Forget it. The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner? Let <u>me</u> talk to them.
Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.
Commissioner.
What?
I just wish it was that simple.
That's right, Commissioner. Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
That just doesn't make any sense.
That just doesn't make any sense.
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.

I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
You've made your point, Commissioner. There's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that's Clarence Oveur. He's got a lunar flight today. I want him pulled. Jacobs, pull Oveur!
Forget it. I was reading.
I was reading too.

Accelerators down.
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.
You better check it, Unger.
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
You better check on it, Mr. Dunn. I'll stay here and fly the ship.
Dunn.
Sir?
Sir?
You better take this.
Elaine.
Te...!
Te...!
That's not important now, Elaine. We have to talk.
It's got to be stopped!
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
I mean the Mercury flight. It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.
Ted, what's wrong?
Ask Simon.
Ted, you're overworked. You've been flying yourself into the ground.
There's nothing wrong with me!
There's nothing wrong with me!
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine! It's all here in the design specifications! Look! It's all here!
Elaine.
Ted, please. You're just making things difficult for yourself.
Elaine, what happened to us?
Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon. He's stable. He's a good provider. I want that at this stage of the game, Ted. He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
Eat this spaghetti, Ted. It'll make you feel a lot better.
Who's that, Ted?
Who's that, Ted?
Sammy Davis Junior. Terrible car accident. He hasn't been the same since.
Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.
And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
His name's David Stockman. He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.
Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick. Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time. And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
No goodbyes, Elaine. Just go.
If that's the way you want it.
If that's the way you want it.
That's the way I want it. Just turn the radio on and go.
That's the way I want it. Just turn the radio on and go.
Goodbye, Ted. I don't want to hurt you.
Ted! What are you...?
I have to get in there. I have to stop this flight.
Ted, we're taking off!
Let me by, Elaine.
What are you doing, Ted?
I've got it, Elaine! I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
Ted.
Not now, Elaine!
Not now, Elaine!
Ted!
Elaine.
Ted. I don't know why you got on this flight. I don't know what you're trying to prove.
Ted. I don't know why you got on this flight. I don't know what you're trying to prove.
Elaine, we have to go back.
Elaine, we have to go back.
We can't go back. We had something very special, but it's all over.
We can't go back. We had something very special, but it's all over.
Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted. This ship should never have passed FSA inspection. This thing is held together by string and chewing gum.
Ted, get a grip on yourself. You should never have left the hospital.
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
What word would you use, Elaine?
What word would you use, Elaine?
The word is sick. Ted -- very, very, very sick.
The word is sick. Ted -- very, very, very sick.
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
I'd use the word insane.
I'd use the word insane.
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine. I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine. I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone.
Elaine!
Ted!
Ted!
Elaine, what's going on?
Elaine, what's going on?
Ted, there's no time to explain.
Elaine, I'm going back there. Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
Ted, please be careful.
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
Not now, Elaine.
Not now, Elaine.
I mean until we start to burn up.
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place. You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly. You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.
That was very well put, Ted.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
That might be the news we've been waiting for.
Simon just ejected!
Sit down, Elaine. If this bomb trick works we just might make it. Simon was a fool to eject now.
Sit down, Elaine. If this bomb trick works we just might make it. Simon was a fool to eject now.
You mean...
You mean...
That's right -- premature ejection.
That's right -- premature ejection.
What will happen to him, Ted?
What will happen to him, Ted?
The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds. He'll roast like a pig on a spit.
Are you afraid?
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
We've blown the computer! Elaine! Set course change!
Set!
Set!
Now!
Now!
Compute!
Ted, the lever!
Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder. Let me show you. Ted's problem is in this area. This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.
What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.
I mean for Ted.
I mean for Ted.
You can be gentle with him, Elaine. He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
You can be gentle with him, Elaine. He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
Is that a good sign, Doctor?
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.
Is he making any progress, Doctor?

Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.

And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon. I'm a very lucky woman.
Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart. But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.

I'm so excited, Simon.
I guess this is a first for you.
I guess this is a first for you.
No, I've been excited before.
Elaine! Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
Simon, why has he become so... so...
Simon, why has he become so... so...
So mentally ill?
Meet me onboard, sweetheart. I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
Don't be too long.
Have you got it straightened out now?
I think so.
I think so.
That's my girl.
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
Roger.
Simon, what's happening?!
He tried to disconnect ROK. It gassed him. That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.

My career is shot.
Your career! What about the lives of those people out there. Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends! You'll die out there.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Simon, what are you saying?!
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan. Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
Yes, sir.
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.
I see. What do you think our alternatives are?
I see. What do you think our alternatives are?
We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.
Roger.
You can do it from up here, Captain.
You can do it from up here, Captain.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.

No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.

We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
Love's the same as it always was. It's people who change.

Not if the people change together in relation to that love.

Sure. But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.

Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.

I just wish it was that simple. We really were in love. You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
No. It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.
Well, we laughed. We laughed all the time.
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.
That's very nice of you. Thank you.
Ah, won't you sit down?
Thank you. Cream?
Thank you. Cream?
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?

No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?

Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.

I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.

You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.

Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.'
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?
No. I'm all alone.
No. I'm all alone.
Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
+++$+++ Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
+++$+++ Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
+++$+++ Something about a plane with no pilot?
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
+++$+++ Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
...but after...awhile...you begin to... ...get used to it.
+++$+++ Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
Both pilots!
+++$+++ Can you fly this airplane and land it?
+++$+++ Can you fly this airplane and land it?
Surely you can't be serious.

+++$+++ I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
+++$+++ I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
Well, I flew single-engine fighters in the Air Force, but this plane has four engines. It's an entirely different kind of flying...<u>all</u> <u>together</u>!!!
+++$+++ Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.
Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
+++$+++ ...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?
+++$+++ Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
+++$+++ I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
+++$+++ I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
Surely there must be something you can do.

+++$+++ I'm doing everything I can! -- And stop calling me Shirley!
George Zipp said that?
+++$+++ And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."

Excuse me, Doc, I've got a plane to land.
+++$+++ Captain, how soon can we land?
I can't tell.
+++$+++ Can't you take a guess?
Well...not for another two hours.
Well...not for another two hours.
+++$+++ You can't take a guess for another two hours?
+++$+++ You can't take a guess for another two hours?
No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
+++$+++ I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?
+++$+++ That's right.
+++$+++ That's right.
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
+++$+++ Yes. Yes, of course.
+++$+++ You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.
A hospital? What is it?
A hospital? What is it?
+++$+++ It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
+++$+++ It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
Certainly.
+++$+++ What was it we had for dinner tonight?
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
+++$+++ Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
+++$+++ What did he have?
He had fish.
Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.
+++$+++ Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
+++$+++ Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
He had fish, too.
Just how serious is it, doctor?
+++$+++ Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
+++$+++ Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?
No.
No.
+++$+++ All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
+++$+++ All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
Well...
No. No one that I know of.
+++$+++ I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.
Elaine!
Ted!
Ted!
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.

I just don't want to go over it any more.

Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
You expect me to believe that?
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
But if you'll just give me...
But if you'll just give me...
It's too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry.
Ted, what are you doing here?
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.
What's the matter?
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.

Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
I love you, Elaine.
I love you, Elaine.
I love you.
Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?
I remember everything. All I have are memories.
Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!
You got a telegram from headquarters today.
Headquarters!? What is it?
Headquarters!? What is it?
It's a big building where the generals meet. But that's not important right now. They've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid. Isn't that good news?
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.
Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
What's his problem?
That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp.
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
Rain.
And a little ice.
And a little ice.
And a little ice!
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
Rats! I've lost number three.
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan.
But Ted, you're the only...
I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.
Ted...
Yes?
Yes?
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
The gear is down.
See them, Elaine?
Uh-huh.
We have a visitor.
Hello.
We'd better get back now.
Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.
Who wants to be first?
Airsick?
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.
You promise you'll write.

Every day.
Good-bye, darling.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.

And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
Yes, Captain?
Yes, Captain?
Did you decide on a runway yet?
Did you decide on a runway yet?
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.
You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.
He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!
Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.
He's right on the heading.
All right, he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner.
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.
Yeah, I think he is. Hey, Fred!
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
Oh, I can't stand it.
What is it?
How ya doing, honey?
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
Here.
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!
I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!
I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
I'm an airline pilot. Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.

Yes?
+++$+++ Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?

+++$+++ Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
+++$+++ Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about. We'll get back to you very quickly.
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
Roger.
Huh?
Roger.
Huh?
We have clearance, Clarence.
Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?
No, why don't you take care ot it?
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
Excuse me, Sister?
+++$+++ Yes?
+++$+++ Yes?
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...

Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.
Thank you.
Do you feel all right, sir?
Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
No. No thank you.
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...
The cockpit? What is it?
The cockpit? What is it?
It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes?
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.
Would you go up, please?
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.
Oooh. Hardball. That sounds interesting. Are you going to strike me? You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
You've got me all wrong. I don't charge money for something that I myself find pleasurable...
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be. He comes and he goes.
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson. Maybe he knows.
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson. Maybe he knows.
Todd? Todd doesn't know either.
I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right? Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
A virgin. I find that very arousing...
There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list. Don't take it personally.
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out. A little scared... and a lot curious. Maybe more than you want to admit. But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together? Think of it as broadening your horizons.

She did, did she? Well, she was wrong. Excuse me, I have to change.

You ever try to make a case in Slagtown? The list of Newcomer informants is about as long as the list of Mexican war heroes...
Look at your dildo partner. He's too scared to even come down to the sand. You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron!
I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.
Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?
Lay off, asshole.
Lay off, asshole.
I may be an asshole, but at least I'm a real detective, not some outer shit space thing.
William Harcourt?
Yes...
Yes...
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.

You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
That's right. He and I, along with seven or eight others. Listen, gentlemen, I will be happy to assist you in any way I can -- unfortunately, at the moment, I'm overdue at another function.
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
No, Sergeant -- not history... Eternity...
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
This is becoming a serious breach of security.

He didn't recognize me.
He didn't recognize me.
It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley.
This is getting out of hand. I want you to deal with it. Immediately.
Kill them both.
Here?
Here?
Do it!
... and we work my hours. I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
What's that? Look, Jetson. Get this straight in your head. We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners. And don't call me Sergeant. Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.

I am George.
Man, somebody really hung one on you! I've heard some good ones for you guys... Humphrey Bogart, Harley Davidson. I guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while, coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you. You weren't at the back of the line, were you, George?
My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.
My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.
Gesundheit. You don't mind if I stick to George, do you?
Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right? Whatta you care?
That is exactly so. It is like your name... Sykes. I'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that it sounds like "ss'ai k'ss", two words in my language which mean "excrement" and "cranium".
Let's talk Hubley.
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.

Terrific. A real pillar of the community. Was Hubley missing anything when they found him? Was he ripped off?
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.

The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for. I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...

The murder at the mini-mart is not our case. The Captain said--
Look, you want to fit in here, right? You want to learn how to get along?
Yes.
Yes.
Well, there's a thing about partners, about being somebody's partner. You do for each other. And other people's rules don't mean shit. It's the rules set up between the two of you, that's all that counts. Understand? Okay. Well, my friend and partner was shot last night and I'm after the shitbag that did it. As my partner, I'm asking you to respect me and help me find him.
What is wrong?
Nothing's wrong. I just want to get something straight. You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?
Well... yes, quite possibly.
Possibly. Good. Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other? Does that sound unreasonable to you?
Possibly. Good. Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other? Does that sound unreasonable to you?
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
Great. Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
What's this? What's going on?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing?
Nothing?
Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
What is this?
A rubber. A condom. You know... Coney Island whitefish? Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies. You need this for anything?
Get the picture?
And that fits?
And that fits?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber. It stretches.
Well... Yeah, it's rubber. It stretches.
And still it fits?
Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.
How the hell do you know that?
How the hell do you know that?
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.

So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery. I'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible. Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.

Why the hell--?! Great, fine. You talk to the wife.
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.
Did you learn anything?
Did you learn anything?
A week ago two men came to see her husband. After they left, he was very frightened. She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her. It was Hubley.

Aw-right. What about the other guy?

She didn't know him. But she said her son might.
She didn't know him. But she said her son might.
Did you talk to him?
Did you talk to him?
He has not been home since that day. But she told me where to find him.
Rudyard Kipling? No shit? Listen, we just need a minute of your time...
We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.
Why did you do it?
Why'd I do what?
Why'd I do what?
Agree to work with me? You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us. And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...

My partner is dead! Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says nothing...
Who said that?
At the end of the bar.
Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?
Uh, Matthew...
Uh, Matthew...
Back off, George.
Back off, George.
But I-- .
But I-- .
I'll handle it.
Screw you.
Screw me? That can't be right.
Tell me.
Your mother mates out of season.
Your mother mates out of season.
That's very colorful. But see -- now I've got a problem. I don't seem to be getting much cooperation from you, Porter. So I guess we're gonna have to take this little session down to my office, ya know?
Matthew, you don't have to-- .
Stay back! I'm okay.
You know that guy?
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here. He and I were housed together.

How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
In the camps, we were lodged four to a room. The selection process was entirely random. We did not get to stay with our friends... or families...
If I may make a suggestion... We have different weak spots than you do. Next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect I think you were looking for.
Yeah, sure. I knew that...
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit. How long did it take you to learn English?
Three months. We learn quickly. We adapt. It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
Which one is that? Raw what?
This is mole. It's good.
This is mole. It's good.
I'll bet. Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?

Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
Ss'loka'. It means literally "small but intelligent creature". It loses much in the translation.

Yeah, that's it. Say it slow.
Who is he?
Todd Watson. The assistant manager.
We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.
When will Strader return?
I believe he is probably lying.
Through his ass. Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?
My wife? She worries about me.
Yeah... I know the routine.
You are married?
You are married?
Was. Divorced.
Was. Divorced.
We mate for life. Divorce... is a strange concept to us.

It's like having an eleventh finger removed. It hurts like hell, but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place.
Your home is quite disordered. I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.
I appreciate your honesty, George.
Human children can be very beautiful. Getting married? Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off, then...
Maybe not... I don't know. I'm not sure I'm gonna go. She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there...
... and so, and so the doctor says, "If this is the thermometer, then where'd I leave the pen?" You're not... you don't think that's funny? George, work with me, I always get a laugh with that one. Look, if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand, then where's his pen gotta be?
In the other man's rectum.
In the other man's rectum.
Sticking out of his ass... yeah! See, that's what makes it a joke. There's like a surprise, and your mind fills in the funny picture. Here's this guy with a pen stuck in his ass and he thinks it's a thermometer. Nada, huh?
Your health...
Ta ss'trakyona'...
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
No shit, Holmes. You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
No shit, Holmes. You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
You humans are very curious to us. You invite us to live among you, in an atmosphere of equality we've never known before. You lay before us a beautiful green world, full of freedoms and opportunities... You give us ownership of our lives for the first time... and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves: to live by the rules... rules that aren't made to keep one people subordinate to another, but rules that exist to preserve equality. You aspire to very high ideals here.
I hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you humans are. So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves.
Don't count on me, George. I never had any ideals.
I'm going home.
Yeah, go home. Get some sleep. You do sleep, don't you?
Where'd you get this?!!
A man, a human, was wiring it to your car. I didn't get a good look at him. I must call my wife...
She's going to divorce me.
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
She's very progressive. I'm certain she's considering it.
Well, let's roll, George.
To the... to the beach?
To the... to the beach?
Come on, let's go, dude. Surf's up!
Stop the car.
Why?
Why?
Please, I must get out here.
Please, I must get out here.
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
Stop the car!
It's all right, George. It's cool. Just wait here, all right? I'll be back in a coupla minutes.
Thank you.
What was that about?
Nothing.
... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style.
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...

... and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart. So what the hell's the connection?
What's this nothing shit? It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now. Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it.
You must leave me alone on this.
No secrets, goddammit! You don't hold back from me. Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!
No. I cannot involve you. This is not your concern.
No. I cannot involve you. This is not your concern.
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist! That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either? Am I right? TELL ME! What is it?

We all did.

Where did he get it? Was there any of it on the ship?
No... I am sure not. That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here. But none of my people know how to make it. The process was carefully guarded.

Jesus, this is major. Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
Jesus, this is major. Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
Your people don't know about this part of out past. And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.
George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again.
I must trust you, Matthew. I cannot stop this without you.
They had months in quarantine to develop the plan. Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug. Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery. Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network. And Harcourt--
Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
No, George -- you're missing the point. The drug is evidence. We need to have the evidence, ya know?
Uh, George...
Where is the drug? Where have they taken it?
George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...
Stay out of this, Matthew. Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.
George, c'mon -- lighten up. It's a beauty of a case. Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit.
The fifty kilos, Matthew. I have to find it. I can't let it get out on the street.
The fifty kilos, Matthew. I have to find it. I can't let it get out on the street.
Why? What's the big goddamn deal?

Fuck procedure.
Shit!
Ss-ai!
With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.
It'd be for your own good. I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book. ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going. I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.
What's this about, George? I know that look.
There! Go back. Down that side street.
No! We must do this alone.
Do what?! George-- ?!
What is this?!
... It's Harcourt.
... It's Harcourt.
Harcourt is dead.
Harcourt is dead.
No he's not. Not if he overdosed on the drug. Massive amounts trigger a... a change. Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation. When you emerge you're...

Tell me about it...
I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.
We can't let him get away.
We can't let him get away.
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?

Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.

But there's no more drug.
But there's no more drug.
You understand that. But how many others will?
How do I look?
You look very good.
You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it.
What is it?
What is it?
Casull .454 Magnum. You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.

Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder. Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder. Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
No... two.
Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager. The men liked him. I'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes.
Well, one of the men didn't like him so much...
You think this is the guy who did it?
We think he could'a been involved, yeah. You know him?
We think he could'a been involved, yeah. You know him?
To be honest, it's hard to say. I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
To be honest, it's hard to say. I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
Who else can I ask around here?
Who else can I ask around here?
Wait. You know who it looks like? Yeah. Anderson. Uh... James Anderson. He isn't in today. He took the afternoon off.
Wait. You know who it looks like? Yeah. Anderson. Uh... James Anderson. He isn't in today. He took the afternoon off.
I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.
That where Anderson worked?
Yes it is. Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there. I don't know how these fellas do it.
Don't piss him off, O'Neal. When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before. He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do. I hadda go throw up.
... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon.
Here's Hubley. Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year. Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing. Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
For you, anything.
Released December one. He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April. Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering. He and his wife have one child, a son.
Yeah -- we met him. Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
Yeah -- we met him. Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
I'm sorry, Matt. Nothing here seems to be matching up...
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
Sure. Just a minute.
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already? Let's try again-- Is your name Porter?
Ss'kya'ta'.
Ss'kya'ta'.
What's that?
One of the two men was Hubley, right? What about the other one? Did you know him?
Yeah... I seen him around. High- roller dude named Strader. Joshua Strader. Runs a club on the west side. Encounters.
Yeah... I seen him around. High- roller dude named Strader. Joshua Strader. Runs a club on the west side. Encounters.
Yeah, I heard of it.
Yeah, I heard of it.
That's all I know. You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...
Come on. You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.
Yeah, right. Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
The human?
The human?
Yeah... he was one Martin Helder. White male, twenty-seven. Let's see... wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction, a couple for sale of a controlled substance. Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock.
No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough. Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.
Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.
You took this gut out, too, didn't you?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
Lucky nothing. I had to empty my damn gun into him.
Lucky nothing. I had to empty my damn gun into him.
That's the way these people are. You don't hit both pumps you just piss them off.
Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one. We're just about to start cutting in. You're welcome to stick around if you want. It's really fascinating stuff.
Yeah, I'll bet.
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
You mean the Blob? They're finishing up now.
What kind of test?
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
Did he find anything?
Yeah, Sykes?
Captain. I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death. You know that. Leave that for Fedorchuk.
Departmental policy.
Departmental policy.
You?
Granger and Pitts are already on it.
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...

Don't tell me what to think.
Hope their plumbing's the same.
It is.
How can I go?
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church. Simple. Me and Carol are going.

But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
Shit, if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it, we'd be holding the reception at Buddy's Burgers.
Does that look at all suspicious to you?
Whatever gave you that idea?
You got your vest?
Of course. Right in the trunk of the car.
Of course. Right in the trunk of the car.
Yeah, that's comforting. Mine, too.
Watch the driver. I'm going for a better angle on the door.
I got him. Don't get pinned.
Get outta there!
I can't! Do you mind!
I can't! Do you mind!
I'll cover you! Get outta there!!
This floor's freezing.
Christ. I never saw such a buncha old women. You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
Christ. I never saw such a buncha old women. You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
Would you, Sir?
Whoooah! No shit? I'm impressed.
Let's go...let's go. Cycle through!
Hey, 'Top.' What's the op?
Rescue mission. There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
Movement!
Position?
Position?
Can't lock up...
Can't lock up...
Talk to me, Hudson.
Talk to me, Hudson.
Uh, seems to be in front and behind.
...that's better. Pan it around a bit.
Awright. Fire-team A. Gear up. Let's move. Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.
Okay, let's do it.
Awright! I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast. Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.
Ten seconds, people. Look sharp!
First squad up, on line. Hicks, get yours in a cordon. Watch the rear.
Vasquez, take point. Let's move.
Flame-units only. I want rifles slung.
Let's go. Pull 'em out.
Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.
Say again? All after incinerators?
I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis. It seems to be metabolizing. He should wake up soon.
Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right? One for each person...over a hundred at least.
Yes. That follows.
Yes. That follows.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
That is the question of the hour. We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.

You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others. A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all. It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors. She is the center of their lives, quite literally the mother of their society.

Could it be intelligent?
Could it be intelligent?
Hard to say. It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves. That's if she exists, of course.
That's it. See it? Emergency venting.
How long until it blows?
How long until it blows?
I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours. The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers. About equal to ten megatons.
And it's too late to shut it down?
I'm afraid so. The crash did too much damage. The overload is inevitable, at this point.
I'll go.
What?
What?
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to. I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.

All right. Let's get on it. What'll you need?
It's going to be closer. You better get going.
See you soon.
HOW MUCH TIME?
PLENTY! TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
PLENTY! TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
Ripley...
She's alive. They brought her here and you know it.
She's alive. They brought her here and you know it.
In seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska.
You did okay, Bishop.
Well, thanks, I --
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
You'd drifted right through the core systems. It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
Have they located my daughter yet?
Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
Is she...?
Amanda Ripley-McClaren. Married name, I guess. Age: sixty-six ...at time of death. Two years ago. I'm sorry.
Amy.
Cancer. Hmmmm. They still haven't licked that one. Cremated. Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin. No children.
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there. You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...

I get the picture.

Just tell them what happened. The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
You are a head case. Have a donut.
No. There's no way!
Hear me out...
Hear me out...
I was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there? Forget it.
What about you? What's your interest in this?
Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights. We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'
Yeah, yeah. I saw the commercial.
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.

Spare me, Burke. I've had my psych evaluation this month.
Yes, and I've read it. You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
No! The answer is no. Now please go. I'm sorry. Just go, would you.
Yello? Oh, Ripley. Hi...
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them. Not study. Not bring back. Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them. Not study. Not bring back. Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
That's the plan. My word on it.
You never said anything about an android being here! Why not?
Well, it didn't occur to me. It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
I hope you're right. I really do.
I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.
That the atmosphere processor?
Uh-hunh. One of thirty or so, all over the planet. They're completely automated. We manufacture them, by the way.
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
Yeah? Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...

That's not what I mean. Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
That's not what I mean. Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
She's right.
No good. How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry? I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit. It's the only way to be sure.
Now hold on a second. I'm not authorizing that action.
Now hold on a second. I'm not authorizing that action.
Why not?
Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments. Let's move cautiously. First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --
They can bill me. I got a tab running. What's second?
They can bill me. I got a tab running. What's second?
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --

Bullshit!
You son of a bitch.
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
What rank? I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
What rank? I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
Corporal Hicks!?
Corporal Hicks!?
This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command. Right?
Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division. Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes. Set up for life.
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.

You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
But they will know about it, Burke. From me. Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
But they will know about it, Burke. From me. Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
Now, wait a second --
Now, wait a second --
You sent them to that ship. I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right? And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in. Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.
Sorry to disappoint you.
Look, we don't know what's going on out there. It may just be a down transmitter. But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor. That's all.
You wouldn't be going in with the troops. I can guarantee your safety.
You wouldn't be going in with the troops. I can guarantee your safety.
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
Still nothing from the colony?
Dead on all channels.
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.
It's insured.
What's he scanning for?
PDT'S. Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
We're talking thermonuclear explosion.
Shit. Apone, collect magazines from everybody. We can't have any firing in there.
How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?
Thirty-eight...simulated.
Hold at forty. Slow circle of the complex.
The structure seems intact. They have power.
One of us?
Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
Where are your parents? You have to try...
Gorman! Give it a rest would you.
What is it?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Proceed inside.
So.
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
So? So?
GET THEM OUT OF THERE! DO IT NOW!
Shut up. Just shut up!
I told them to fall back...
They're but off! Do something!
How do you feel?
All right, I guess. One hell of a hangover. Look, Ripley... I...
All right, I guess. One hell of a hangover. Look, Ripley... I...
Forget it.
At ease. I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...
Sir?
Sir?
Yes, Hicks?
Yes, Hicks?
Hudson, Sir. He's Hicks.
Hudson, Sir. He's Hicks.
What's the question?
What's the question?
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved.
Are there any questions? Hudson?
How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us. First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line. Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...
...We're coming in.
...We're coming in.
He's coming in. I feel safer already.
Sir, the CPU is on-line.
Okay, stand by in operations. Let's go.
Hah! Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen! Found 'em.
Alive?
Alive?
Unknown. But, it looks like all of them. Over at the processing station...sublevel 'C' under the south tower.
We're not making that out too well. What is it?
You tell me. I only work here.
Save it.
Sure, Hicks.
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Not that tunnel, the other one!
Well that's great! That's just fucking great, man. Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!
Are you finished? You okay?
Outstanding. Then all we need's a deck of cards. All right, let's move like we got a purpose.
Aye-firmative.
We got problems.
I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.
The corner! Ready?
Do it!
Seventeen meters.
Let's get these things lit.
Well you're not reading it right!
Six meters. Five. What the fu --
Let's go! Let's go!
Fuckin' A!
Removed surgically before embryo implantation. Subject: Marachuk, John L. Died during procedure. They killed him getting it off.
Poor bastard.
How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?
About seventeen days.
All right. There's a fire door at this end. The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
That's right. So we put up welded barricades at these intersections... ...and seal these ducts here and here. Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here.
They're in the approach corridor.
On my way.
Now many?
Can't tell. Lots. D gun's down to twenty. Ten. It's out.
Newt time then can walk right up and knock.
But they don't know that. They're probably looking for other ways to get in. That'll take them awhile.
They'll get us.
Maybe. Maybe not.
Maybe. Maybe not.
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others. You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others. You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
If it comes to that, I'll do us both. Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.
What's this?
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
Look, you started this. Now show me everything. I can handle myself.
Look, you started this. Now show me everything. I can handle myself.
Yeah. I've noticed.
Wait a minute. We'd know about it.
The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back. Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse. You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
Let's waste him. No offense.
It's game time.
Get back here, both of you. Fall back to Operations.
They learned. They cut the power and avoided the guns. They must have found another way in, something we missed.
We didn't miss anything.
Locked.
Stand back.
No! No! She's alive! We have to --
All right! She's alive. I believe it. But we gotta get moving! Now!
Hicks, don't let him leave.
We ain't going anywhere.
Ellen.
Don't be long, Ellen.
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
No. Have you?
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
Anytime. Anywhere.
All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest?
Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?
Yeah, bullshit. Watch us.
Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!
Oh, man. And I was gettin' short, too! Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock. It ain't half fair, man!
Hudson, give us a break.
It's inside the complex.
You're just reading me.
You're just reading me.
No. No! It ain't you. They're inside. Inside the perimeter. They're in here.
Sounds like you, Hicks.
The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours. Gestating. Then it... ...then it...emerges. Moults. Grows rapidly --
Looks like it stung him.
Hey...hey! Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
You can't help them. Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
Oh, God. Jesus. This ain't happening.
Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours! Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...
She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.
This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.
Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.
Thanks.
Uh, what's next?
We need the other drop-ship. The on one the Sulaco. We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
How? The transmitter was on the APC. It's wasted.
How? The transmitter was on the APC. It's wasted.
I don't care how! Think of a way. Think of something.
I don't care how! Think of a way. Think of something.
Think of what? We're fucked.
Think of what? We're fucked.
What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end. Why can't we use that?
Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there. Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.
Oh, right! Right! With those things running around. No way.
They cut the power.
What do you mean, they cut the power? How could they cut the power, man? They're animals.
This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...
Just get back here!
Range twenty meters.
Seal the door.
Fifteen meters.
I don't know, an acid hole in a duct. Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!
Twelve meters. Man, this is a big fucking signal. Ten meters.
They're right on us. Vasquez, how you doing?
Nine meters. Eight.
Can't be. That's inside the room!
Can't be. That's inside the room!
It's readin' right. Look!
You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the Ilium range, a couple days ago?
Yeah. What?
Yeah. What?
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team. Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.

Christ. Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look. They don't say why, and I don't ask. I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'

So what do I tell this guy?
So what do I tell this guy?
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
And how are we today?
Terrible.
Terrible.
Just terrible? That's better than yesterday at least.
Just terrible? That's better than yesterday at least.
How long have I been on Gateway station?
How long have I been on Gateway station?
Just a couple of days. Do you feel up to a visitor?
Bad dreams again? Do you want something to help you sleep?
No.. I've slept enough.
What did you say?
Newt. My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
Casey. She's my only friend.
What about me?
I don't want you for a friend.
Why not?
Why not?
Because you'll be gone soon, like the others. Like everybody. You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.
They'd be here if they could, honey. I know they would.
They're dead.
They're dead.
Newt. Look at me...Newt. I won't leave you. I promise.
Newt. Look at me...Newt. I won't leave you. I promise.
You promise?
You promise?
Cross my heart.
Cross my heart.
And hope to die?
I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.
The 'maze'? You mean the air ducts?
The 'maze'? You mean the air ducts?
Yeah, you know. In the walls, under the floor. I was the ace. I could hide better than anybody.
Yeah, you know. In the walls, under the floor. I was the ace. I could hide better than anybody.
You're really something, ace.
I guess we're not leaving, right?
I'm sorry, Newt.
I'm sorry, Newt.
You don't have to be sorry. It wasn't your fault.
Now you just lie here and have a nap. You're exhausted.
I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
Oh. Sorry, Newt.
Oh. Sorry, Newt.
My mommy always said there were no monsters. No real ones. But there are.
Yes, there are, aren't there.
Why do they tell little kids that?
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.
Did one of those things grow inside her?
I don't know, Newt. That's the truth.
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
No, it's different, honey.
No, it's different, honey.
Did you ever have a baby?
Did you ever have a baby?
Yes. A little girl.
Yes. A little girl.
Where is she?
Where is she?
Gone.
Gone.
You mean dead.
Don't go! Please.
I'll be right in the other room, Newt. And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
Newt. Newt, wake up.
Wah...? Where are...?
Wah...? Where are...?
Sssh. Don't move. We're in trouble.
Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.
I know, honey. Me too.
Burke! Open the door!
Look!
Come on. Crawl faster.
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
Sure. Go left.
This way. Come on, we're almost there!
Newt, wait!
I knew you'd come.
Newt, I want you to hang on, now. Hang on tight.
Mommy...Mommy?
Right here, baby. Right here.
Are we going to sleep now?
That's right.
That's right.
Can we dream?
Can we dream?
Yes, honey. I think we both can.
Look, I told you...
+++$+++ It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.
+++$+++ The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...
That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock! Like I said.
Look, I can see where this is going. But I'm telling you those things exist. Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs. Thousands. Do you understand? I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data. Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...
+++$+++ Thank you, Officer Ripley. That will be...
+++$+++ Thank you, Officer Ripley. That will be...
...because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew, within twelve hours of hatching...
Why won't you check out LV-426?
+++$+++ Because I don't have to. The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship. And by the way, they call it Acheron now.

I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that.
No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.
No! I won't have him back.

Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.

I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.

Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?
Of course.
I think you're mad! You're really mad!
Oh, leave me alone.

One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!

Stop it now. Stop it. I've brought some friends to meet you. They're next door waiting. Do we have anything to eat? They're all starving.
Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.

My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
He's not Herr Mozart. Call him Papa.
May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?

She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.

Oh, damn!
Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -
Stanzi!
Stanzi!
No, it's right he should hear. I'm sick to death of it. We can't do anything right for you, can we?
We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder? This is! a very nice girl.
Wolfi.
Wolfi.
Yes, my love?
Yes, my love?
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.

Salzburg. We were just talking about Salzburg. If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!

No one.

I heard voices.

I'm not telling you.
I'm not telling you.
Why not?

You'd think I was mad.
No. Don't answer it!
Why?
This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.

Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please!
Excellency!
Madame. How can I help you?
Frau Mozart?
That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.

Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.

Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
It is miraculous.
Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.
Oh, thank you, sir!
Come back tonight.
Tonight?

Alone.

What for?

Some service deserves service in return. No?

It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.
But! I'm a married woman!
But! I'm a married woman!
Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price.
I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?
What?
What?
Should we stay here? It's a charming room. I love these candlesticks. Were they here earlier? I didn't notice them I suppose I was too nervous.
What are you doing here?
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.

He's not going to work on this anymore. It is making him ill. Please.
I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my wish and go.
Madame, I will respect his. He asked me to stay here.
How much will you pay him?
Ah. Well. Ah, I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?
Am I interrupting something?
Not at all.
Not at all.
Where's our friend?

I see that you're expecting.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
When, may I ask?
When, may I ask?
In three months! Papa.
What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.
But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!

Thank you, Madame. Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.
You are cattivo, Court Composer. I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
What a charming idea. May I see?
It's just a trifle, of course.
It's just a trifle, of course.
May I try it?

Majesty.
Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
You do me too much honour, Sire.
You do me too much honour, Sire.
Let's have some fun. Bring in Herr Mozart, please. But slowly, slowly. I need a minute to practice.
A-flat, Majesty.
Ah-ha!
And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.
Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
My pleasure.
Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
Cattivo again, Court Composer. Well, tell him, Mozart. Name us a German virtue.
Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.
Your Highness.
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
Yes?
Yes?
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.

Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.

Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson.
Do you like this, Salieri?
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.

Well, look at them.
Your Majesty!
No, no, please! It is not a holy relic. You know we have met already? In this very room. Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old. He was giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no?
Oh, thank you.
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
Majesty!
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
Why so?
Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.
It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the whole thing is set in a - in a -
Yes, where?
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.

Ah-ha.

Yes, indeed.

What do you mean, Sire?
What do you mean, Sire?
Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say? How shall one say, Director?
I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.
My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?
My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.
Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.
Enchanted, Madame.
Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.
Excuse me, but how old are you?
Twenty-six.
Twenty-six.
Well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna.
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
Thank you, Sire!
Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
What is it?
What is it?
May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.

Ah! By all means.
Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
Yes, Sire.
Yes, Sire.
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?

Who told you this, Majesty?

It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Would you tell me why?
Would you tell me why?
Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here.
Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
I think you are rather innocent, my friend. In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece.
But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
Ah, love again.
Ah, love again.
But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on. On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?

Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives.
Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
Sire, the whole opera is finished. Do you know how much work went into it?
Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
+++$+++ I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
+++$+++ I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
Very small pay, I imagine. I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say, an opera in German for our National Theatre.
Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?
+++$+++ In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.
+++$+++ Yes, sir.
Well. There it is.
Well, what do you have for me today?
+++$+++ Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -

Yes, what about him?

+++$+++ He's here.

Ah-ha. Well. There it is. Good.
I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.
I will.
Why are you here?
Am I not welcome?
Am I not welcome?
Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa!
Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see.
Is she not here?
Is she not here?
I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!
Do you always live like this?
Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.
She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
Don't you have a maid?
Don't you have a maid?
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.

Why didn't you mention it in your letters?

Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.
Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.
Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!
No, really!
This is just a game, Papa.
Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!
I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
Papa, is this your idea?
Mine?
Are you playing a trick on me?
I never saw this girl in my life. Is this a kind of joke?
Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
Papa!

Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.

Father -
Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
Good morning, sir.
Good morning, sir.
What have you got for me today? Let me see.
Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.
I will, sir.
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
Yes, thank you, sir.

I think I've found out about the money, sir.
Yes what?

Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.

Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.
Well?
Sublime! Utterly sublime!

That kind of music should be punishable by death.
Wonderful! He liked the monkey, didn't you?
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
I liked the horse.
Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them.
I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.

'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.

I tell you I picked up a snake in Dresden last week - twelve foot long - folds up to six inches, just like a paper fan. It's a miracle.
I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.
German!

Of course! What else do you think they speak here?

Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you. Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.
And which one of them do you want me to teach?

You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
Madame.

This is Herr Mozart, my dear. The young man Herr Salieri recommended to teach our Gertrude. Where is she?
I'm afraid I am.
Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?
Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose. How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!
Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?

Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.

Really?

Ah!

A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things.
Love, Sire!

But this is absurd!
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.

Herr Mozart, what brings you here?
Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.

Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't.
Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?

Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
